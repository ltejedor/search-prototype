', 'content': ["Larry: Let’s just sample a few other things that are central and that can be really interesting for you, beginning with right now. I mean even when you leave, you’re not this moment. A lot of what is the foundation of meditation has to do with learning about and taking care of the body, learning about speech, and then of course the mind itself. Let's take speech. When the teacher that I mentioned whose name was Krishnamurti said, “pay attention as to how you actually live,” the part that was most difficult for me was to pay attention as to how I use these two lips. When I would create a friction, engineered some friction and words would come out, it was sometimes very painful to hear what was coming out of my mouth. If you pay attention–you have to really listen–with an open mind, with a mind that's just the famous beginner's mind. I don't know. Just really, “how do I do talking?” And that includes not talking, silence. Sometimes we've used this at the center since the beginning as a practice for people. Sometimes people are very shy, so called introverted. As they pay attention to this realm of communication, they see that they have things to say, and they don't say it, and that it's painful for them. And that little by little they start to speak more. And then blabber mouths like myself we get quieter. It might be hard for you to believe that because if you see me only on Wednesday nights, there is life for me outside of Wednesday night where I can be quite quiet and happily so. So, right speech as you start to pay attention as to how you actually live is another fundamental area of human life that helps put a foundation in for the so-called higher things. And in that, what tends to happen as you pay attention is your speech becomes more accurate and more precise. More and more, you say what you mean and you mean what you say. And the gaps between what you say and the motives that you have and the gaps between what you say and your actions start to narrow down. And when they don't, you see it. That's part of self-knowledge is getting on to yourself. It's an extraordinary journey, and it's not easy because what you're doing is you're seeing this self unfold. And what's being said is learning how to live and self-knowledge are really the same thing. The degree to which we don't understand ourselves no matter what that is, each person–there's no standard here–you have to understand yourself, me myself. The degree to which you don't understand yourself is probably the degree to which you're suffering unnecessarily. Ajahn Chah, who's a teacher, whoop, I'm quoting someone else, who wants to pinch me? I’ll pinch me. Let's forget about that one. Who cares what Ajahn Chah said? Now I have to say it. But I forgot because I'm so in the moment. When you start paying attention to speech and you begin to see what comes out of your mouth, just hear it in an open way, not only does that reveal a lot to you about yourself but also you start to learn about listening because you can't do speech. Speech won't get refined unless you learn how to listen. In fact, it's only if you start paying attention to speech and listening that you learn the art of listening not only to yourself but to others. And so, this art of paying attention as to how you live, how you actually live from moment to moment. And what Ajahn Chah often said was that you can use all the techniques and do all the retreats that you want. Finally it's going to come down to, however you got there: Do you understand yourself? To what degree? Or don't you? If you don't you're still going to be suffering a lot because actions are going to come out of you that are not beneficial for you or for others in your life. And as you come self-knowing–and that's why it's so precious–that's what's really lacking on planet Earth. It's not an energy crisis. It's an understanding crisis. We don't understand ourselves. And writ large the human race does not understand how to live on this potentially beautiful planet. Okay but I'm not getting Utopian. Each one of us, we have a life to live. And these are just a few hints of the ongoing way. And then of course it starts with just one memory that I had, just came to me, a teacher that I had in Thailand some years ago. “Regarding right speech,” he said “what will help you most of all is when you start to tap silence in your mind.” And I was puzzled by that. “Why while when my mind becomes silent will my ability to understand my speech develop?” He said, “when your mind becomes silent you start to be able to really hear what you're saying. And if it's, let's say like a discordant note, if you're a musician, or you know chalk on the blackboard that screeches, it's painful when you hear yourself saying something that's BS. Do you know what I mean? Exaggerated, not true, designed to form an impression. And it does and people like it. And then somehow it leaves a residue that is a little unsatisfying in us. If you start to pay attention. If you don't, roll on, just go on your merry way of saying things that aren't true, that make you feel good. Okay, so, it's a substantial activity. And it's not just psychological because in the seeing of it there's a letting go of all kinds of attachments; otherwise it won't happen. And, again, it takes us to clear mind.

', 'content': ["Larry: Finally the mind itself, and now of course we're starting to get into the big stuff; we already have with speech. And in this particular approach, in Vipassana and the Theravādin tradition, I don't think it's different than the other Buddhist schools that I've trained in, but I don't know them as well. I've suggested becoming more familiar with the body, just how to take care of the body. Now, to back up a bit, Buddhist wisdom is needed there as well. The wisdom of the Buddha is very, very important there because you can get so good at caring for the body. And in this age many of us are. There's just a lot of information and encouragement now to eat properly, to exercise, to do the very things I just said. And science is, there's some staggering breakthroughs. Herbal medicine, which I know a little bit about, is bringing together high tech with folk medicine, so called thousands of years of herbal wisdom and laboratory techniques of extraction that enable herbs to be so pure and effective beyond what the ancients could do. And now yoga even made it to Newsweek or Time magazine? Someone a while back, someone in some exotic posture. And so you can get so good at being healthy that you look younger, have more energy, are more attractive, and get compliments. And when you have more energy, you have more energy for more mischief. And if you're trying to bring the body into some reasonable condition–I'm not saying become obsessed with it–in order to provide the basis for deep seeing and the development of liberating wisdom. And in the process, you get sidetracked into having a body that you want to live forever, to defeat aging, to defeat everything. The War against Aging, as one magazine which I was asked to subscribe to “join us in the war against aging.” ", 'Questioner: Sounds like we might lose. ', 'Larry: What? ', 'Questioner: Sounds like we might lose. ', "Larry: Yes. It's like, “we declare war on the Atlantic Ocean.” The battle is already… You can raise your handkerchief as the white flag. It's over. So, it's that view of things. But the possibilities of vanity and getting attached to the nature of the body and attractiveness and health and youthfulness of the body has always been there. The Buddhists specifically talked to it. And a reflection that you get in many Buddhist monasteries no matter what age you are it's given to young people, really young. “I'm of the nature to age. I'm not exempt from that. Everyone ages.” You reflect on it, not to be a downer. “Why don’t you to let the kid enjoy his youth?” It's not that. It's that often there's tremendous vanity attached with youth and with health because it's if we have it forever and we don't. Ok, so there are many safeguards. Some of you have been around the block a while with Buddhist meditations, you know about them. They're reflections and contemplations to balance it.

And how do I engage with it? ', 'content': ["Larry: But then we get to the mind itself. And in this lineage, in this approach, what's emphasized is seeing the three poisons of the mind, the three toxins of poisons. You've heard it, if you've been around here. They’re sometimes called greed or grasping or the wanting mind, that mind that's always wanting something. It can be very subtle. It can be enormous. And it can want anything, from sex to food to power to money to fame to a whole country to anything. It's constantly wanting to become something better than what it thinks it is, to get more than what it thinks it doesn't have. That mind is considered a toxin. Of course, you need desires. It's not saying desire is bad. When that mind is there, the practice is to be mindful of it, to come to know it. It's in its form as an obsession, fixation that it produces suffering. Obviously, the desire to eat and to take care of yourself is a natural part of survival. What I'm talking about is what produces suffering when it's out of control and distorts everything else. So, self-knowledge would of course begin to, in those mind moments, it's not in the abstract, it can come up anywhere. It's coming to see in those mind moments, is there craving and wanting in that moment? Want want want. And if there is, what's that like? See that's where the learning how to live comes in. It's not saying, don't crave and don't want because it's bad. You're a bad person. What it's saying is, it's an unskillful mental state. It doesn't work. It doesn't bring happiness. It brings suffering to you and to others. And so, when the mind is in that state of neediness, of wanting, don't be in a hurry to rid yourself of it. Slip in under and see what that's like. Is it a nice feeling? If so, carry on. Make it even stronger. Accumulate even more. More fame, more money, more sex, more power, more whatever it is you want. More shoes, more cars, more… I don't know. It can be anything. More meditation accolades. The mind is free to latch onto anything and turn it into a torture chamber or heaven. Okay, so what's the mind like when it's that way? What's the mind like when it isn't that way? When the mind is at peace with the way things are? Again, learning happens. In some ways, it's not so different from old Pavlov and Skinner because a lot of learning goes on that way. We begin to see this learning is painful. It doesn't produce happiness. That's wisdom. All these religious paths exist because suffering exists. If there was no human suffering, would we need religions in churches and synagogues and mosques? I don't think so. We need them because we're suffering a lot. And to some degree, they may help. I want to get into, that's a big one, right? And so how do you learn? It's not to just follow it blindly. It's not a new belief. Buddhists don't believe to not grasp on to things that everything is empty and arises and passes away. Fine. I'm a Buddhist now. I believe it. And however many Buddhists are on the world, I feel a sense of belonging. We Buddhists feel that there's no self and we don't believe in grasping. I think at a certain point, it won't be very fulfilling. It's just another belief. It's dead. It doesn't have much liberating power, if any. In fact, it may just do the reverse. And as you begin to see when the mind is content, as one of my teachers called it “just enough mind” rather than “not enough mind,” to see that. So that's a valuable piece of self-knowledge. It enables you to learn your way out of certain emotional states that are not working for you. If they are, full speed ahead, of course.

And how do I engage with it? ', 'content': ["Larry: The next one is aversion or aggression or anger or, in the extreme, violence and killing. What's it like when you're furious? What's it like when you're resentful? Envious? Is that fun? It can be bittersweet. But when you look at it with a sustained look–this is not about thinking. Real mindfulness is like an empty, clean, clear mirror. And when you see what it's like to be in that frame of mind: what the body is like, what quality of energy is that like? And what's it like when that's not there? When, let's say perhaps there's love or kindness or compassion instead? Maybe the first one, when there is an absence of craving? Or when you feel just generous and the joy of giving but genuine giving? And so, you begin to feel your way or learn your way into ways of reeducating your own mind. And only you can do it. It doesn't come from a book. It comes from reading your own nature. Now the meditation practice, which in Buddhism is central, is designed to equip the mind so that it's strong, stable, and clear enough to be able to do this work. Because if the mind has no steadiness, my words may sound reasonable to you, but you won't be able to do it because as soon as fear comes or something else comes, blown away. Well, that's true for all of us at the beginning. But it's like any other art. It can be learned. If you want to learn this art, do you want to learn how to live? Maybe you're happy the way you're living already. Good. Maybe you just came here out of curiosity or your boyfriend comes here, your girlfriend comes here. You're welcome. But that doesn't have much energy.

And how do I engage with it? ', 'content': ["Larry: The other toxin or klesha has to do with the quality of the mind. That is, when the mind is confused, dark, ambivalent, ignorant, hesitant, befuddled, bewildered. Because the root problem in the Buddhist teaching is ignorance in the mind. That is, the mind is deluded. And that's why it thinks that the more it grasps and accumulates, the happier it will be. It really believes that. When the mind gets clear and looks at it, it sees that that's not so, not as a new ideology. You can have lots of stuff and be happy or you can have very little stuff and be happy. That's not the point. The point is what is that quality of mind and what does it produce and what are the consequences, whether you call it karma or cause and effect. If you're willing to see how you actually live, you can begin to see those actions, verbal and otherwise, that are beneficial for you and for others. You can see the ones that aren't. But are you willing to learn? Are you willing to actually learn? Sometimes what that means is seeing mistakes and apologizing. Sometimes it means being very discouraged and seeing, “my God, I thought I was through that one but I guess I'm not.” But it's not to give you a final report card. What we're learning is how to live a real life. The only way that I know that life can be real is if we are, if we're real. And so, how do you do that? So, the seeing has to become more and more accurate and clear. To begin with, our minds are not clear because we're invested. We have strong likes and dislikes. When the mind is not clear, it's not enjoyable. I think we all know that. And so, see what that's like when the mind is so confused and makes decisions that it doesn't even have confidence in. And see what it's like when the mind feels clear. Sometimes that mind comes upon you, in meditation certainly, but it's not limited to meditation. Suddenly life is so much simpler. You see, someone's hungry, you see somebody's sad, someone's happy. And it's obvious what to do. Life is not any easier in one sense, but the simplicity of it, which comes from the clear seeing, enables the behavior to be appropriate, accurate, wise, kinder. You can see that that's a big piece of the practice.

', 'content': ["Larry: I want to get questions and answers going but I want to link it a little bit, in a small way, with what is going on since 9/11. What I'm about to say is not new because the problem that we have has existed since the time of the Buddha. It exists now and it existed… who knows? In the Buddhist scheme of things, it's a beginningless beginning. There isn't some origin of the universe. It's sort of like on and on and on. When you have something as striking as that unexpected event that occurred where thousands of people who are just helplessly killed. And I don't have to repeat that, you all know what it is. It is quite, can be, for most human beings, it is quite a shock, just as an individual shock. Someone who's in good health suddenly dies, and everyone's surprised, or some disappointment or just the opposite, just something totally unexpected happens. Every moment is a moment to learn about yourself. But this one has tremendous potential. That is because there's so much energy that's trapped in the reactions that come about when something as dramatic as this happens. The tremendous amount of fear, the anger, the apprehension about the future, seeing perhaps how uncomfortable you are with not knowing the future. See, again, it’s self-knowledge, it never takes a holiday. So that whatever happens, in addition to it being a social event which the whole planet shares, it's an individual event. How are you taking what has happened? Forget about how anyone else has. I've been speaking to really a lot of people for months now, not only here but elsewhere. Some people will say, “I don't feel all the horror and the terror that so many other people do. And I feel bad about that.” I said, “Okay, that's what you practice with. How do you feel?” “Well, I just feel a little bit neutral.” “Okay, start there. Don't feel you're supposed to feel like someone else.” Self-knowledge is really training in honesty. But it's not that you ever have to tell anyone else. It's you being honest with you, which is most important. Even if you lie and do something awful and never get caught, no one ever finds out, you found out, and it forms a residue in the consciousness, perhaps sinks down in the subconscious. But it's there, and it has a debilitating effect. It's a psychic toxin just like food that's inappropriate, it can be a toxin for the body. Okay, so what is happening elicits very strong reactions. And, if you're a person of practice, if you are a yogi, you're practicing Vipassana or some other meditation. This is a hard time for everyone. There is no one who is exempt from it. But it can be also a very rich time for you because it can unearth fears and problems that have nothing to do with 911. Many people have seen that: fears that they thought they were done with or that they had basically had buried since childhood, old wounds. If you're willing to practice with it and begin to take a look at what this brings up, a lot can be learned. In order to do that, of course, the clearer you're seeing is, the better. I'm going to go a little bit over if you don't mind, but I don't think it will be more than 5 minutes over. I know some of you have a tight schedule. By the way if you have to leave right now, I won't be offended. You might have to catch a train or something. It's fine. We have to work with the mind that we have. Some of you are relatively new. Maybe you just walked in and this sounds interesting. You can start practicing right now. It's not to wait until the mind is perfect. Whereas if you have an interest in understanding your life as you live it out - understanding here is not just thinking understanding. It's not chronic introspection; we already know how to do that. Many of us do. It's not that. It's much fresher and more alive and actually finally enjoyable because it brings energy. You don't get headaches from this one even though sometimes what you see is painful. So, we start with a mind that is ill-equipped perhaps to do this, and we have to do the best we can. I don't know.

And how can meditation help? ', 'content': ["Larry: Well, a few weeks ago, I was watching CNN and I saw what we're up against, and, actually, it was a pretty good metaphor for why meditation exists. And, I was watching an interview with an Afghani woman who obviously had suffered a great deal from the Taliban, and she was trying to describe the condition situation for women in Afghanistan for the past five years. The interview is, there's a question and answer going, but do you know what crawl is? Those of you don't know it crawl is that incessant nonstop ticker tape that keeps going. “…Osama bin Laden has been founder… A president… A president just receives an award…” It keeps going I guess 24 hours a day. I don't know. But every time I turn it on, there it is again. And on this occasion, and some of it is repeated, old stuff. I said “Hey, wait a minute. I heard that ten days ago. I mean, someone is asleep here. You know, get rid of that.” In the meantime, I've missed 30 seconds of what this poor woman is saying. On top of that, on the upper right hand where, they start showing what's going on in Kandahar: bombing and you know. And, so there I am, and there's an announcer and music and I'm trying to watch. This woman is trying to tell her story. And I'm really interested. And, in the meantime, the crawl is getting me, sort of like, I'm looking up there, and then Kandahar’s over here with planes. And, finally, it just occurred to me, who designed this? This is insane. I said, somebody must think that this is a good way to do things. And I realized, of course they do, because that's how their normal mind is. I realized this is how our mind is. Let's say, right now, maybe this, you’re more focused here hopefully. There's something happening and you're aware of it. In the meantime, the crawl is always going on. The mind is starting to say blah blah blah blah…used to be…I will be… That's a lot of baloney, but smile anyway. And then you think that Kandahar is just happening in the upper right. Then there are images floating through your mind at the same time that you're looking and the crawl and the images, and that's the mind we're going through life with. Meditation exists because that mind exists. And it's sort of like, how can at least sometimes turn crawl off? Let Kandahar take a rest and just listen to the woman tell her story without music and America fights–all of this hoopla. Just a simple story of one person asking a question, seemed to me that was much more powerful than whoever drummed up that. That's what we're up against. By the way, sometimes people who are new get the idea that, “Oh, what he's saying is that thinking is no good.” I'm not saying that. Thinking is magnificent and necessary and beautiful. It's created so much. It's just that we don't know how to use thinking. Thinking is using us. It would be as if you have a beautiful car, whatever car you like, Mercedes. I don't know, whatever car you like. And, it's great and you drive it around, but then you have to get over a lake. You don't drive the car into the lake to get to the other side. The car can do certain things and it can't do certain other things. So you get out of the car and you get on a boat. Do you see where you get it? We're using thinking in areas where it's counterproductive. For example, we're trying to measure what's immeasurable.

', 'content': ["Larry: Ok, to get to the link–it's really quite a big subject–but, one of the things that I think the Buddhist saying directly is that you are the world. As you get to know your own mind, you're getting to know everyone else's mind too. No matter where you go. If you prick us, we bleed. We don't like it when our children are hurt or die. We're afraid to get all…we're all humans in back of all the different outfits and cultures and foods and ideologies and all the rest of it. And as you get to know yourself, I have found it to be so, without any special effort, you do start understanding other people better because we're the same. To jump a lot of steps. To whatever degree my mind became clearer because I've been looking at what this has evoked in me. It has evoked things in me. And without going into my particular biography because it's not important. Because what's important is what this event has and may in the future bring up for you. In those moments when the mind is clear, what I have seen and I'm not telling you to see this, and this didn't come from books that I read, although I'm sure there's nothing novel or particularly interesting or creative about it, but I saw it myself, a lot of it from watching news and listening to people. First of all, what becomes really apparent is that there's an enormous gap between technology and wisdom. It's like Grand Canyon. Wisdom is feeble. I mean planet, the level of understanding on the planet, the level of maturity of us human beings. We haven't learned how to live together. And it seems as if we don't want to spend energy doing that. Our energy has gone in the direction of magnificent technological accomplishments. I'm not saying to stop that, but if all the best energy of every generation goes in that direction, don't be surprised if we don't understand ourselves because it's not held up as an important value. It just isn't. So, children are brought up to become great scientists or technicians or whatever it is. We're not brought up that the quality of your life is supreme, really important. You're here to live your life. What is the quality of that life? Not the gross national product. Now that's okay. So education isn't just to get a job. Education should be to understand yourself. It's part of education. So, I think that part of the problem is an immense, the wisdom is overwhelmed by technology. We can't handle it. We've created energies that are so far beyond our grasp that we're all in danger. This is not about the Al Qaeda or Taliban, that's topical. We're all in this together. It's a planetary problem. And the sooner we see it, the better. And our contribution to it is there. And I'm not saying I'm a fanatical 60’s peacenik who we just never recovered from the 60’s. I'm not saying that. It just seems obvious that it isn't as simple as good guys and bad guys. That to some degree, each one of us has contributed to what's going on. If we still have lots of greed and craving, we want lots of things. And if we want lots of things, they have to come from somewhere, and we need the energy and we want it. And then parts of the world, the energy comes from there. And in the process, all kinds of imbalances are developed. Like we have to have oil from the Middle East in order to do what we like to do. And we don't want to be deprived of that. That's an individual thing. And someone would say, “Well, we should get out of Saudi Arabia, but you'll have to turn your thermostats down to 60.” “Well, I don't know. I mean Saudi Arabia looks pretty good to me. They like us. You know, they just can't say it publicly. So I hear.” Anyway, the gap between the massive power of technology and the lack of development in us as individuals, self-knowledge, and extend that to the race, the human race, that is. I feel it comes down to something like this. It's not that I want you to believe this. It's that, find out what you see. This came out of some seeing. What I see is that the power of the media has created, helped create in a dramatic way, a global economy. And everyone's talking about that, how wonderful it is. But, when you look at the media, it's very clear what's going on. It's not to me… it's that we have a global economy, but we don't have a global consciousness. Consciousness is tribal still, and that includes us–if you have a better word, sectarian, nationalistic–so that you have people, we're all in each other's faces through the media and through the global economy. But consciousness is not the kind of consciousness that can live in a global economy because we're still mired in tribal mentality where it's all about me and everyone's doing it. I'm not singling out America. The United Nations is a bunch of self-interested individual countries jockeying for power and influence, and veto this and that. So certain people are rubbing up, cultures are rubbing up against each other. They're not ready for it. They don't understand them. We don't understand. And yet we keep coming together and coming together. There has to be a commensurate development of consciousness. And so when you work on yourself as an individual this may sound really utopian, and maybe it is, but personally I'm going to do it anyway even if it doesn't help the world. I am doing it, I hope. As you work on, because greed, hatred, and delusion, we can see it in our own individual life. But the world is an extension of that. Countries get greedy and countries get angry and countries solidify and countries simplify reality. I just want to leave it at that. So in working on yourself you are in some, even if it's tiny way, contributing, planting a seed, if you will, for a world where we go deeper. Because right now we're living in such superficialities. We are willing to do business with each other but we take the most superficial aspect of the person to be what's real. It isn't what's really real. Anyone who's meditated knows that. When you go deep, you're not a Jew or an Arab or even a Buddhist, for goodness sakes. When the mind is clear there's no name tag for it, there's no brand name, there's no label or slogan that applies. It's just your being, there's being is there. And it's wonderful. And it's not that we have to abandon our particular country and ethnic group and that adds the color to the life. But it doesn't have to be held with such ferocity and such making. We're so identified with the surface of what's going on because we haven't gone deep enough into ourselves. That if everyone's doing that and it's so great that we have a global economy, but we have a provincial mind, how can that work? And so, I would say maybe it's self-serving because I'm in the business, but self-understanding is what's really called for now. There's a shortage not of energy but of understanding and that's for all of us. We don't understand ourselves as a planet. And all the conferences and legislation and peace treaties, they're helpful. I'm not against doing sensible things. They just are so weak and feeble because the mind states haven't changed. Just look at what happened to the Communists even if you like it. A good ideology, but people were just the same people, and it didn't work. The inner is much more powerful than the outer, finally. Okay, I'll get down from my soapbox. But it's not…Please, I really, sincerely beg of you. I am not trying to convince you of any political ideology or whether you should be for the war against the war, protests. Let the clarity of your own mind help you know how to behave from here on in because if what's been said is so, it's not over. It's going to unfold and there are going to be more challenges. The practice should help you live in the midst of those challenges by developing some more wisdom, so that even though we're all challenged you're not overwhelmed by what happens. Okay. If anyone has to leave, please, and let's start the questioning in. Let's give it a minute or two.

It's that we're here to help you understand how you do it. ", 'Questioner: If you could give us an example of. ', "Larry: Well, I gave you one. I told you that by following my own reactions the mind became quiet. And I saw that this is a world problem. It's a planetary problem and that all of us are contributing to it by having minds that are not contemporary with the way the world is now. The mind is still tribal. That's the best term I can come up with. And the world is changing so fast that boundaries, we’re are all intermingling, and we don't know what to do with it. The Soviet Union falls apart and suddenly you have everything, endless ethnic groups emerging with pride and flags and foods and fighting and all. Whereas what the world needs is not that. And begin to understand, like let's say if you get critical of what the president's doing or what's going on, take a look and look into yourself. For example, if your kind of patriotism, let's say, personally I'll go this far: I love the United States. I come from an immigrant background. I know what my parents have been through. I inherited their suffering in other countries. And America has been incredibly good to me. I have no words for it. I did serve in the military blah blah blah. But all I'm trying to say is that it doesn't. And I'm Jewish. It doesn't stop me. But it's taken work over the years. I have a deep love of Israel. I can't help it. It's conditioned. But, for a while now, I honestly feel tremendous sympathy for the Palestinians. And I hear the Israelis argument is so one-sided. It's like they produce something and then they complain as to why they get hit back. But then the Palestinians are doing it as well. It's like neither of them can be happy unless the other one is. And all they do is so that I'm able to let's say love this country but not set it up in such an exclusive way that I can't hear what certain Arab thoughts are, certain criticism of what's going on and try to weigh it. Even the bad guy, Osama bin Laden, I've tried to listen to what he's saying. Some of his critique is not insane. The solution is not as it may be. And him as a person is not that interesting to me. So, if you're willing to, everything that's going on reveals something about yourself. So, in some ways I'm contributing to it by… let's say if I'm marching around with the flag–and I've seen it in Harvard Square where someone was doing a political thing, and this was within the first two weeks. They didn't have an American flag, and someone came over. It wasn't even about pacifism. It was about a different political candidate in the next election. And I said, “Well, where's your American flag? You never served in the military.” I saw the beginnings of a fight. And I looked at this person and said, “I'm a vet. And how come you…” and so that kind of American stuff is not helping anyone and that's part of what has contributed to it. And then we're all doing it to each other. So, if you can liberate yourself – and, of course, the Buddhist teaching is no matter what you say, it's always, like, start with you. I will say something. This may sound, I hope it doesn't sound conceited. To me, it's something that grows out of practice. There is hope. The period prior to this happening and for a while prior has been an extremely happy one for me, and it has not been interfered with by this. There's just a tremendous ongoing joy. It comes from meditation, quite honestly. And I also like my life, but I also have experienced sorrow. They both can coexist. The sorrow has been sometimes about the low level at which the human race is steeped. It's not abstract to me. It's sort of like how can we do this to each other? Okay so there's a certain depth of something that doesn't get pushed around by the event and all of us have it. That's the point of what the Buddha is saying. There's something in us that's stronger than anything that happens to us. Whatever name–I won't name it for right now–whether you call it Buddha nature, original nature, and it's accessible to begin to taste it. Okay. That doesn't mean you become like a stone. If anything, it's more poignant. You become more sensitive to cruelty and so forth. And both are coexisting inside of me. But there's a foundation that doesn't seem to budge. If you think that's egocentric, I'm not saying I'm a big enlightened guy, I'm just trying to describe something.

', 'content': ['Questioner: How to work with fears that come up, you’re saying work with it… ', "Larry: Nothing special except that it's a powerful object. Let's say fear comes. Okay. Throw the word fear out. There's an energy that's there. And you could feel it coursing through the body, right? There's very strong bodily sensations if you're afraid; it's not vague. The heart, the posture changes, well, you know. That's available. Go right to that with mindfulness. And then the mind will start churning out thoughts that are all disabling. “You're going to die. You'll be crippled. It’s doom. It's hopeless.” They're ideas. They're just thoughts. Now with practice you can begin to see that they're just thoughts. And if you can attend to the energy of the fear with mindfulness, that means sustained seeing. And, at first, that's hard to do because we're afraid to look at fear. Most people never begin. They're lowered into the grave with fear, I'm afraid. Whoop. I didn't mean to be clever, but it's true. I'm not really afraid of that. But what I've seen in the people that I've worked with and myself, unless you get fed up with fear–and that is a piece of self-knowledge–you begin to see the price you're paying for fear: how it cripples you, cuts off all kinds of creativity, prevents you from taking certain risks that could be creative and useful. And you begin to see that it's quite a steep price that we pay for allowing fear to control us. But then there's an incentive to gently, softly start inching towards it. And it's the same practices with the breathing: it's to receive it as it is. It's just energy. See what I'm getting at? Okay. That's the purest and the most direct way. And at first it'll be hard because there'll be resistance. You'll be afraid to look at fear or you hate it. And then, so you look at that. You look at how much energy there is in not wanting to look at fear. You heard what I said. Did you understand my words just now? Seriously, it's a question. Okay. And let's say fear comes up and you say, “Great, it sounded good up in that hall. But now the last thing I want to do is take a look at my fear.” Then take a look at that. Take a look at how much you don't want to look at fear, at resistance. You'll feel the body. It's not about fear now. It's contraction in the face of fear. And then little by little you learn your way into how to… you see fear is workable because it's observable. If it weren't observable, it would be hopeless. It isn't hopeless. But it's just like any other art: the art of cooking, the art of painting. It's putting things in their right place. Fear has a proper place in life. Sometimes it's quite intelligent and saves us. But a lot of it–the fear we're talking about now–is neurotic fear. There isn't a real threat in this moment. It's not doing you any good. It's just exhausting you.

But it's a very convincing one. You believe in it. ", 'Questioner: But I’ve often found that it’s overwhelming. ', "Larry: But who makes overwhelming? How do you cut out of the cycle of me? Firstly you've concluded that's overwhelming and then you find it, “Well, I was right. It is.” It's a one woman show. You're playing all the roles. You see what I'm getting at? That's what we're all doing. It's Marcel Marceau. You know? If you don't know… you're doing a whole thing. But now, I'm not trying to force your head into the fear. You get into that fear and you look at it, if you're a yogi. I’m not saying that. You can be gentle, but it does take a certain courage at the beginning and an incentive, an interest in wanting to really understand this so you can be free of fear or at least weaken it. I've seen people with horrible panic attacks, horrible, learn how to disarm them. And they're not doing it…It's the same old, boring Vipassana technique. Nothing new. It's just that what you're being asked to be mindful of is not something you want to be mindful of. And it's a rough one, but it too can be learned. So let's reenact it. “Oh my God, this is overwhelming.” Start right there. Forget about fear. Just realize that you've already concluded that this is hopeless. And, it may be so big that right now your awareness isn't ready for it. There may be an element of truth in what you're saying. And so that's why the samatha or concentration practice is also so important. Do you know what I mean by that? Okay. Have you worked with the breath in an exclusive way? That concentrates the mind and that makes the mind more fit, strong, steady. It needn’t be the breath. It can be mantra. There are many, many ways. But you take one thing and you come back to it again and again and again. Okay. Out of that, the mind starts becoming more steady. And so then, you won't be as likely to feel overwhelmed because probably it's true. Your mindfulness is a baby mindfulness. You haven't done so much of it and certainly not with fear. And so it is easily overwhelmed. So, it's both in a way. That is, you start little by little approaching it and seeing that maybe it's workable. But also, see, every time you're mindful, that's what gets stronger not just on the cushion. You mindfully do the dishes. You're taking a walk into the square and you're aware of the experience of moving. Every time you mindfully hear a bird chirp, the car stops because it's a red light, and you're with three or four breaths until the light becomes green and you drive. All of that contributes to refashioning and reshaping the mind so that it is able to do the things that I'm talking about. It's not like you walk in here, you hear this rap, and then like, far out man and you just do it. This is not a quick fix. This practice is for adults. What the Buddha is saying is you're responsible for your own happiness. And we are being given the tools both in terms of teachings and also techniques to enable the mind to be up to the task of looking at itself. Because to begin with it probably isn't.

Then sitting makes my mind very sleepy or unclear, unproductive. And I kind of stopped reading Krishnamurti. I said why? He said all I would say that, it doesn't work. So I said myself I just have to do it continuously. And now after several years I came here and I'm listening, and I have been starting sitting again.

But we won't be able to because what happens is these old impulses reinstate themselves and color everything. So it's not that we have to be perfect. What we can do though is we can begin to learn from our actual reactions. And that's why the force of generosity is called a purification of mind. Any moment that you practice this, you're reconditioning your mind in a beneficial way. When you practice greed, then you're making that stronger. Hoarding, you're strengthening that. Just even a moment, even a thought about it. For example, just to reflect–and this is a reflection in Buddhist practice–people will sometimes go on retreats and take some time, some Tibetan practices are like this, where you reflect on past occasions when you were generous. It's not to kind of pat yourself on the back and build up your ego. It's just to acknowledge how joyful it was to be generous, how you enjoyed: Your friends came over, and you have this meal in the refrigerator, but, okay, let's share it. And you had a great time. So you reflect on past moments when you were generous, and you allow yourself to re-experience the generosity. And the deeper your samadhi or concentration, you mix your samadhi in with that recollection. What you do is, in those mind moments, you're now giving yourself the inner feeling of the joy of generosity, which then makes it easier for actual generosity in the now to be forthcoming.

That is if you don't allow–I don't know if it'll be funny now, but you know who The Lone Ranger is? Okay, it's not important. I'll explain who he is. He was my childhood hero. When I was growing up, there was a man: he had a white horse, and he wore a mask, and he had a cowboy outfit, and he had an assistant who was an Indian. What? ", 'Questioner: It was a man on TV. ', "Larry: This was radio, honey. Okay, so this man was The Lone Ranger. And The Lone Ranger would constantly be doing good things. You know, he would just save this person and donate this. But when people wanted to thank him, he would always ride off. And they would say, “Who was that? He's gone.” And finally, one of the episodes I remember, and it just struck me as hilarious, where people got really furious with him. You know, just sort of like, “You're always riding off. You never let us thank you.” Later on, Lenny Bruce who was a comedian, made an extended, very good thing out of that. And so, in some way, he's not allowing the people who he's helped to express their appreciation. And this is a common thing, let's say in relationship, where sometimes the way to give someone something is to allow to receive. Is that what you're getting at? Yeah. That's why, finally, it's a subjective thing. It has to do with the inner meaning for you. It's not out there. ", 'Questioner: There’s another aspect to it. Different people keep talking about material objects. Sometimes, you sense the intention that they give. But also there is this embedded thing about possessing things. You are actually giving it away, so they’re conscious of that too. There’s always fear of “Am I going to get something back?” Maybe they might not even be aware of it, but giving is so powerful that they give it. Somehow, I tend to understand these things, and then you have to deal with the person’s psychology–pushing them or something. The energy they give. ', 'Larry: What is it you’re pushing in them? ', 'Questioner: Giving is done from the heart. But there is a subconscious period, maybe lasts for two seconds or three seconds… ', 'Larry: On whose part? The donor or the recipient? ', 'Questioner: Both, I guess. ', "Larry: Okay. Yeah we're not perfect yet. And so whatever it is, it's all right. It's moving in the right direction. This seems to be an evening for Samu Sunim stories. A number of us started a center in New York City. And at the opening of it, many Korean people came, really a lot. And they brought flowers for the altar which is a custom in Buddhist for Buddhist temples to signify impermanence. Flowers wilt and die. They're beautiful, you appreciate them, and then they die. It's a teaching. And these Korean people brought plastic flowers on the altar. And there were a number of us. I remember one person in particular who had very strong sense of aesthetics. He was a poet. He's now a very famous poet. And, when no one was looking, we'd whisk them away and hide them under the clothes. And then these Korean women would find them and just put them back out again or there would be more brought. And we did it a few times and finally we went to Samu Sunim. “Samu Sunim, we have this beautiful new temple and they keep putting all these plastic flowers,” and we were complaining. And he says, “These women have very pure hearts.” He said, “Your mind is made of plastic.” Many of the monks, part of their job is–especially the very mature ones–part of their job is to provide people with an object who receives things, but they don't need anything. For example, it's quite common…I'm just thinking about, our time is running out. Ajahn Chah, who some of you have read, you've read his book. So there was an American Monk who had an interest in art and he saw all these wonderful works of art being donated to Ajahn Chah and being brought to his little meditation hut. And at one point it became his turn to clean up Ajahn Chah's hut, and he was very excited because he wanted to see all this great art. He came into the hut; it was totally empty. All that was there was a cot and mosquito netting and totally empty. The same with Maha Bua. Maha Bua is one of my teachers. He's given things. It's like a department store after some of the piles of, you name it, and you go into his “cootie” or his little house and all I saw was a jar of medicine and a map and a cot and mosquito netting. So apparently what's happening is people are giving them. “Thank you very much.” They give it to someone else. People give them money. “Thank you very much.” So they're a medium, a means for the person to practice on, to develop generosity. But they don't need it. It would be stupid for them to just pile it up when they don't use it. So they then just recycle it just as with the extra food. Okay maybe one last one and then call it an evening, if there is anything on anyone's mind. Sure.

But it's not going to uproot jealousy. It will kind of soften jealousy a bit. Let's say jealousy is like this: it's a bit like Adolf’s tenderizer. I don't know if that exists anymore. It's something you put used to… I haven't eaten meat in a long time but, I'm vegetarian. I just want. I'm a nice person, passive as vegetarian.

Don't throw the other out there. They're all tools to help you move towards freedom. Okay. Now you have certain feelings towards another person. The logic of this practice is, as unpleasant as it may be, you have to see those feelings. But, if you can, observe them with a loving eye, nonjudgmental. It's sort of like being aware of whatever it is. What would you call it? What would you call it? Whatever it is that you don't like about an attitude you have towards some another person, right?

Now, there's an interesting thing that happens. It's called breaking the circuit. It's in all religions that I know of. The opposite of that is an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. I go like this; you go like that. Then I kick you, and then you hit me over the head with it. And then we're all toothless and blind. And we wonder why is everyone so ugly? Supposing this person is doing their thing, but you've examined the part you're doing. But not just thinking; you actually see it, and it gets weaker and falls away. Then they do their thing, but it isn't met in kind. See that's what Gandhi did. Gandhi returned violence with love. Aggression with love. He wasn't a Patsy, obviously. He was firm. Okay, you understand. Now, breaking the circuit. If they do their thing and you don't do your thing. It's like they throw a punch, and it's just air. That's what I meant about, if either the Israelis or the Palestinians, if one of them could just say, “I'm going to be bigger. When they point their finger, I'm not going to point mine. I'm just going to stop doing. I'm going to remove the settlements, unconditionally, no matter what they do. Or…” Do you see what I'm getting at? It gives the possibility for a new dynamic to emerge. No guarantees. Do you see what I'm getting at? Use the practice to help you. You can't live the other person's life for them, but you can change the condition so that they have a chance to perhaps rise to the occasion too and meet you. Yeah please.

', 'content': ['Questioner: A while ago, you used the phrase attachment to emptiness. ', 'Larry: Yes. ', "Questioner: I have no idea for sure what that means. But I was thinking before I heard that about impermanence, and for some reason I've accepted impermanence of things, I mean over a long period of time. ", 'Larry: As an idea? ', "Questioner: Within myself. That things that I loved were torn down and people die and things like that. And I haven't been practicing a great deal for very long. But, over years, I've felt that way about impermanence. But I also was wondering if you accept impermanence fairly easily, when people are mourning and people are crying, maybe about the same things, that you wonder if there isn’t a certain insensitivity or coldness. ", 'Larry: But this is all imagining on your part. Speculation. ', 'Questioner: Is that attachment to emptiness? ', 'Larry: No. ', 'Questioner: Being attached to this turning off, of no response? ', "Larry: No, I don't think so. First of all, let me deepen or add to or amplify what you were saying. Now, no matter how much you feel you have understood impermanence because of losses and so forth, the practice of Vipassana would be from moment to moment–let's say when you're sitting–seeing that each breath arises and passes away; each idea in the mind arises and passes away; each mood comes and go; sounds come and go; the body is uncomfortable, then it's comfortable; then you have high energy, then low energy. And you penetrate to a deeper level of understanding of the law of impermanence at work in your own mind, body. And that has transformative power. You're already on your way. You’re launched. So that's part of it. Now, what that helps you do is let go of your attachment to forms. Now, some people are good at it to begin with or better than others. Some are so attached to their minds that they're going to suffer tremendously. Whatever the mind churns up, it's true. They grab, and it's just immense torment. But as you start to see what, the mind is impermanent. It's not just that the people were. One minute you were this, the next minute you were that. And you see what the nature of the mind, it's not a thing. It's a process: full of contradictions and randomness and unpredictability and it's out of your control. Then it loses its power. And that takes you to a much deeper place that we were talking about, which is here right now. Okay. Emptiness. If I… attachment to emptiness, let's say I remember I described that I used to live here. ", 'Questioner: Yeah. ', "Larry: Okay. And let's say, which I think there's some truth to, I was attached to a form. It was a good place. It protected me. Just anyone knows even if it's a humble little place, it's your own. And you can do what you want in there and be quiet. Now if I'm really holding on to that, and then it's taken away from me, then I suffer a lot. And then someone comes along and said, “Hey, you're attached to it. That's why you're suffering. Look what they're doing. They're tearing it down, and they're making it into a meditation hall.” And you come back and you look at it and then, you're right. It was nothing. The attachment to emptiness then is like a kind of disrespect for the form. The apartment had its value. If you attach to the emptiness you're getting attached to the… Let me use an example that's more within all of our range. Flowers. Anyone who loves flowers, probably everyone here or most of us, we love flowers. And you put them in water, and then they're beautiful, and we love to look at them, and their scent and so forth. And then they start to wither and wilt, and then they die, right. Maybe the first few times you start sobbing. But typically, now as adults, we see it in some Buddhist monasteries, it's a practice to let it go to the point of withering. They don't immediately take it out and put another fresh batch in because they want you to see it as a teaching. Not overdo it when it starts to be like that. So, you watch the flowers and you enjoyed them while they were there. Now, here are other ways of doing it. If you got totally attached to flowers, then you would suffer immensely every time they withered. That part is clear to you, right? Okay. But supposing you say, “They're worthless. I'm never going to have a flower again. They just go and die on you because what do they do? They just come up and then they go blah blah and then they're gone.” Okay. That would be in the direction of attachment to emptiness. It's fine to love the flower as you understand its nature. If you understand its nature, you don't have expectations that have nothing to do with its nature. You want it to last forever. It can't. It's not a mistake. This is the way nature is. Or as one of my teachers used to say, “It's like looking at a waterfall and saying, praying to God, bowing everywhere. ‘I want the water to flow up.’ It's going to keep flowing down. That's the nature of water.” The nature of flowers is to emerge, blossom, bloom, and then to wilt. You're new to this. Don't get involved with all this emptiness stuff yet. ", 'Questioner: No. One of the things I was thinking of is things that I… like a village, that I visited 25 years ago, 35 years ago, fishing village in the coast of Spain as a kid. And it was beautiful. It was very picturesque and everything. Ten years later, I was going back as a… chaperoning some other young people, and it was gone. It was…. umbrellas on the beach. Everybody that sold out, they were gone. And friends of mine were also there were really hurt to hear about it, but this is what happened. Economics, not only nature, but economics does this. My town is torn down where I grew up, and I accept that stuff. But I can enjoy the memory of it without being attached or mournful. Or as you get older, you get a lot of good memories and some bad ones. But I can keep that memory without feeling… ', "Larry: Okay. What's your question? ", 'Questioner: This attachment to emptiness. Is it… ', 'Larry: That village, excuse me? ', 'Questioner: That coldness, you know. Where everybody else is… ', "Larry: I don't know. Do you feel coldness? Then you would feel cold. Someone wouldn't. I'm not legislating how you're supposed to feel at the end of this. But, the village as you knew it, that was the way it was empty of an enduring core. But, one way or another, it had to go through that, just as the flower did. The whole universe as we know it, the sun is not going to–I don't know 2 trillion astronomers tell us, not astrology, they probably think they're here for, anyway. So we know that that's the way things are. But then when it comes to numero uno, me, somehow we go blank. We don't understand. Now, that's fine. You are comfortable with your village. Now, it evolved into something else which is not totally different, but it's also not the same. So, in the language of the Buddha–it's just technical language–it was empty of an enduring core. It had no autonomous reality. It doesn't mean that it didn't exist or it was a hallucination. It existed as long as certain conditions held it together. The conditions changed. Just what happened now, there are certain conditions brought this terrorist thing that came together, more than we can figure out, that brought this to bear. And now there's no World Trade Center. And do you see what I'm getting at? “Emptiness sickness” is when you get fixated on the nothingness of it all. And you disregard the fact that form is here to stay. And that our life is in the midst of forms that change. And the problem, the suffering isn't from the changing forms. The suffering is from our fixation. We hold on to things and then if they change, we have a hard time accepting it. And that's where the pain comes in. One more please. Please, you, yeah.

', 'Larry: Okay. ', "Questioner: I've been hearing a lot of things about impermanence, and I try to think about it when things don't turn out to be the way I expect it to be. But sometimes when I try to be happy I also think of impermanence, and I know it's not going to be there with me all the time. So I don't understand how you can be happy if you think about impermanence. ", "Larry: But I'm not saying think about impermanence. See, if I can tell you from the point of view of this practice. I mean, you know, I learned my stuff in Thailand. So who am I to tell you anything? It's in your blood. You could tell me a thing or two, I'm sure. There are two kinds of insights; I mentioned them. One is reflective, that's a skillful use of thought. And the other is direct seeing. So you know that things are impermanent. And sometimes in a way we talk to ourselves sort of like, “Oh of course, this had a change,” and it helps ease things. Okay. But then it's not like what is being suggested here is we go around keep thinking “impermanent, impermanent.” But you can learn that when happiness is there, you can enjoy it. And then when it's gone, it's gone. Let me take a very simple example: sunset. Let's say there’s a beautiful sunset. No one's saying you can't enjoy it. You're there, and it's just beautiful. So much in nature is, especially if the mind is clear. And you're appreciating the sunset and it goes down. Your heart is all warm, and it's beautiful. No suffering. Then the next day, you come running back to get it again. And it isn't the way it was. Or you start comparing it, “in Acapulco was better than…” The first was joy. One way to talk about it was joy. The second was a quest for pleasure, where we try to get it. Now if you can allow yourself to be happy when it's there, knowing that of course it's not going to last forever. And while you're happy, you're happy. It's just a fact. And then it's gone. And then what's next is what's next. Now there's a deeper place than happiness, unhappiness, happiness unhappy. And that's what Rumi's point. There's a place that isn't. The happiness you're talking about is subject to vicissitude. Change. Coming and going, rising and falling, praise and blame, healthy and sick, all those kind of things. If you can get comfortable with it, be with it, let it go. Be with it, let it go. It takes you to someplace; you could call it “true happiness,” that's deeper than whether you have good fortune or bad fortune. Good fortune must alternate with bad fortune. Good health and bad health, praise and blame, wealth and poverty, strength and weakness, all of those. If you don't believe me, check your life. Is there any of those qualities? You have them forever? I don't think so. But we're talking about something that never… anything that arises passes away. What the Buddhist saying is something that never was born, so it can't die. Okay, so it's not that you shouldn't be happy. But when you're happy, enjoy the happiness. And when it's gone, just know the truth of that, and be with what's next. That's the practice. Does that make sense? Okay, one more and then really we should… please.

And I'm glad that when they called us about what Buddhists think, that you refused; that they were trying to impose a tribe there. And my immediate reaction to 911 was feeling like I'm being asked to be part of this tribe, America; it's not my tribe. I want to find: who are my people? what is my country? And so I went to peace demonstrations immediately and people were talking about forgiveness and all of that. And I thought this is my tribe, on some level. And now I'm coming, as I'm stepping out of that, I'm realizing that's not right either. There's plenty of people who I can identify with who are not so sure that we should behave peacefully or whatever.

And not the person, throw the question out. Yeah. ', "Questioner: Because when things happen I look toward myself as the cause of the suffering because of clinging or expectations or whatever. I have an individual that everything is always somebody else's fault. He's always looking. And you said this in part of your talk about the people who look externally to the other place to find the reason why they're suffering. If they keep doing with different people or in different circumstances. Essentially like mankind has done the same way of solving the problems of looking at the problems. Now you can't really look to advise people of what to do. You should go to the CIMC; that will straighten you out. But it's hard in the relationship that I'm talking about to sit idly by and not trying to make that person more conscious about the need to do what you talked about tonight. ", "Larry: Yes. It's very common with all of us. In fact, one of the things, over the years I've spoken to many couples, and it's very common for one person to be a meditator and the other one isn't. My wife is not a meditator. I'm vegetarian. She's not. There's a whole long list of things. She's born in Russia. I was born here. She doesn't know the most obvious. So what the heck are we doing together? Can a meditator and a non-meditator live happily together? What I found is the key thing is respect. Now I'm going to get to what you're asking. That is, you have to respect this other person's right to not be as wise as you by coming to CIMC, et cetera. I am being a little bit sarcastic, but you understand. And, of course, for a friendship to happen or a marriage or a partnership, they have to respect your right to do this kind of work. Then I've seen it work. When it becomes a political football, it doesn't work out too well. So what to do? Because certainly I'm not exempt. Sometimes I see ways in which people I love: my sister, she doesn't have these resources and she has no interest at all in developing them. Every time we visit with each other, should we go through the same exchange? “Larry, what is this meditation?” And my wife has told me, “Don't go through it.” So about ten or I'll go through a whole long thing, a mini dharma talk, and she'll look very interested, and it'll go wheee-whooo. And then the next time, it's the very same thing. She's not interested. But here's the piece that might be of some help. It has helped me and certainly some other people. You have a reaction to these people, people who are, let's say, it's one person in particular. Okay. You have a reaction and that reaction, you can't help that reaction: You feel badly for them. You feel impatient. You feel frustrated, whatever you feel. But, in a given moment, instead of trying to make the ideal Buddhist action or compassionate action or whatever is so good, focus in on your reaction: that it's bothering you; that it's frustrating; that you're annoyed with the person; that you feel sorry. Whatever is you're feeling, from moment to moment. It's not thinking about it. They come in your presence, and you can see what's happening, and you have a reaction. Now the reaction is mechanical. It comes out of your conditioning. Okay? So, if you're aware of the reaction–and a lot of practice in daily life is just that. It's becoming aware of our reactivity, which is automatic. It comes out of our upbringing, our school system, our wounds, our joys, et cetera. If you're aware of it–that doesn't mean trying to eliminate it–but you're aware of it, little by little it loses its power, and then that creates a space. In that space, I don't know what you should say or do. Maybe nothing. But I have greater faith in the clear mind that replaces the reactivity because out of that comes what you could call a response. A response is not mechanical. And sometimes, for example, here's one thing I had to learn with my wife. She would come home. She works in a hospital with a lot of very elderly sick Russians who are in pain and complaining and et cetera. And then she comes home. And then at times she'll start and then I have a beautiful dharma talk to give her. And that's not what she wants. She just wants me to listen. And it took me I don't know two or three years. I finally learned. I said, “Oh duh, you're not interested in my immense storehouse of wisdom. What you would like is to just be a person who cares to listen to her.” And I talked it to her, and she says, “Yes! that's exactly what.” So that was hard for me to learn how to do that because I'm in the fixing things business. But I've learned that now what might come out of the new space that you create by taking care of the reaction–it gets weaker and weaker as you do that–is maybe it's silence. Maybe you say the same thing that you've been saying for a few years, but the energy is different, and the person is much more able to listen. Or maybe you ask a fresh question to them that never occurred to you before. I don't know. But I trust that space. That's the beginner's mind that some of you have read about. The “don't know” mind. It's the freshness rather than coming out of all of our formulas and recipes for what would be good for that. Do you see what I'm getting at? ", "Questioner: The reason that I asked for this kind of insight into how to help this person–that's my desire, to try to help–is that I haven't said anything. I haven't reacted. I created that exact space and I'm kind of drawn back from it. I do understand how I feel. ", "Larry: But you're having the reaction inwardly anyway. Otherwise, it sounds like it. Sounds like a lot of frustration there. ", 'Questioner: I see that there have been so many decisions that have been made that have been very hurtful, the outcomes that he wanted. ', "Larry: I got it. I understand. But I'm sorry to interrupt. ", 'Questioner: There are other people involved in the life that are going to get caught on a crossfire, like a spaghetti western. The same kind of themes over and over. ', "Larry: Okay, but here's what I'm saying. The fact that you restrain yourself, that's one extreme. The other extreme is a person just reacts verbally, all the time or physically. The other is you restrain yourself, but the reactivity is still going on, and it's building up in you. And you want something else. Whether you express it verbally or physically or not, practice with the reactivity. That opens the mind up. I don't know what's next, but you're in a better position. Here's what I found. There's a better chance of what comes out of your mind, maybe even depicting your view of what's going on with other people, that is kinder and wiser. But no guarantees. Do you see what I'm saying? ", 'Questioner: I do. ', 'Larry: Good. ']}]}
