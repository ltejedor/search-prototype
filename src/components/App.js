A lot of what is the foundation of meditation has to do with learning about and taking care of the body learning about speech and then of course the mind itself. Let's take speech. When the teacher that I mentioned whose name was Krishnamurti said Pay attention as to how you actually live. The part that was most difficult for me was to pay attention as to how I use these two lips. When I would create a friction engineered some friction and words would come out. It was sometimes very painful to hear what was coming out of my mouth. If you pay attention you have to really listen. Not with an open mind with a mind that's just the famous beginner's mind. I don't know. Just really how do I do talking? And that includes not talking. Silence. Sometimes. We've used this at the center since the beginning as a practice for people. Sometimes people are very shy so called introverted. As they pay attention to this realm of communication they see that they have things to say and they don't say it and that it's painful for them. And that little by little they start to speak more. And then blabber outside myself we get quieter. It might be hard for you to believe that because if you see me only on Wednesday nights there is life for me outside of Wednesday night where I can be quite quiet and happily so. Okay so write speech as you start to pay attention as to how you actually live is another fundamental area of human life that helps put a foundation in for the so called hire things. And in that what tends to happen as you pay attention is your speech becomes more accurate and more precise. More and more. You say what you mean and you mean what you say. And the gaps between what you say and the motives that you have and the gaps between what you say and your actions start to narrow down. And when they don't you see it. That's part of self knowledge is getting onto yourself. It's an extraordinary journey and it's not easy because what you're doing is you're seeing this self unfold. And what's being said is learning how to live. And self knowledge are really the same thing. The degree to which we don't understand ourselves no matter what that is each person. There's no standard here. You have to understand yourself me myself. The degree to which you don't understand yourself is probably the degree to which you're suffering unnecessarily. Ajan Cha who's a teacher. I'm quoting someone else who wants to pinch me. Let's forget about that one. Who cares what Ayn Shaw said? Now I have to say it but I forgot because I'm so in the moment when you start paying attention to speech and you begin to see what comes out of your mouth just hear it in an open way. Not only does that reveal a lot to you about yourself but also you start to learn about listening because you can't do speech won't get refined unless you learn how to listen. In fact it's only if you start paying attention to speech and listening that you learn the art of listening not only to yourself but to others. And so this art of paying attention is to how you live how you actually live from moment to moment. And what Arjun Chow often said was that you can use all the techniques and do all the retreats that you want. Finally it's going to come down to however you got there. Do you understand yourself to what degree or don't you? If you don't you're still going to be suffering a lot because actions are going to come out of you that are not beneficial for you or for others in your life. And as you come self knowing. And that's why it's so precious. That's what's really lacking on planet Earth. It's not an energy crisis. It's an understanding crisis. We don't understand ourselves. And at large the human race does not understand how to live on this potentially beautiful planet. Okay but I'm not getting Utopian. Each one of us we have a life to live. And these are just a few hints of the ongoing way. And then of course it starts just one memory that I just came to me a teacher that I had in Thailand some years ago. Regarding right speech he said what will help you most of all is when you start to tap silence in your mind. And I was puzzled by that. When my mind becomes silent my ability to understand my speech develop. He said when your mind becomes silent you start to be able to really hear what you're saying. And if it's let's say like a discordant note if you're a musician or chalk on the blackboard that screeches it's painful. When you hear yourself saying something that's BS. Do you know what I mean? Exaggerated not true designed to form an impression. And it does and people like it. And then somehow it leaves a residue that is a little unsatisfying in us. If you start to pay attention if you don't roll on just go on your Merry way of saying things that aren't true that make you feel good. So it's a substantial activity. And it's not just psychological because in the seeing of it there's a letting go of all kinds of attachments otherwise it won't happen. And again it takes us to clear mind finally the mind itself. And now of course we're starting to get into the big stuff we already have with speech. And in this particular approach in Vipassana and the Terravadan tradition I don't think it's different than the other Buddhist schools that I've trained in but I don't know them as well. I've suggested becoming more familiar with the body just how to take care of the body. Now to back up a bit Buddhist wisdom is needed there as well. The wisdom of the Buddha is very very important there because you can get so good at caring for the body. And in this age many of us are. There's just a lot of information and encouragement now to eat properly to exercise to do the very things I just said. And science is there's some staggering breakthroughs. Herbal medicine which I know a little bit about is bringing together high tech with folk medicine so called thousands of years of herbal wisdom and laboratory techniques of extraction enable herbs to be so pure and effective beyond what the ancients could do. And now yoga even made was it Newsweek or Time magazine? Someone a while back someone in some exotic posture. And so you can get so good at being healthy that you look younger have more energy are more attractive and get compliments. And when you have more energy you have more energy for more mischief. And if you're trying to bring the body into some reasonable condition I'm not saying it because I'm obsessed with it in order to provide the basis for deep seeing and the development of liberating wisdom. And in the process you get sidetracked into having a body that you want to live forever to defeat aging to defeat everything. The War against Aging is one magazine which I was asked to subscribe to join us in the war against aging. It's like we declare war on the Atlantic Ocean. The battle is already you can raise your handkerchief as the white flag. It's over. So it's that view of things. But the possibilities of vanity and getting attached to the nature of the body and attractiveness and health and youthfulness of the body has always been there. The Buddhists specifically talked to it. And a reflection that you get in many Buddhist monasteries no matter what age you are it's given to young people really young. I'm of the nature to age. I'm not exempt from that. Everyone ages you reflect on. It not to be a Downer. I want you to let the kid enjoy his youth. It's not that it's that often there's tremendous vanity attached with youth and with health because it's if we have it forever and we don't there are many safeguards. Some of you have been around the block a while with Buddhist meditations. You know about them. They're reflections and contemplations to balance it. But then we get to the mind itself. And in this lineage in this approach what's emphasized is seeing the three poisons of the mind the three toxins of poisons. You've heard it. If you've been around here there's sometimes called greed or grasping or the wanting mind that mind that's always wanting something. It can be very subtle. It can be enormous. And it can want anything from sex to food to power to money to Fame to a whole country to anything. It's constantly wanting to become something better than what it thinks it is to get more than what it thinks it doesn't have. That mind is considered a toxin. Of course you need desires. It's not saying desire is bad when that mind is there. The practice is to be mindful of it to come to know it. It's in its form as an obsession fixation that. It produces suffering. Obviously the desire to eat and to take care of yourself is a natural part of survival. What I'm talking about is what produces suffering when it's out of control and distorts everything else. So self knowledge would of course begin to in those mind moments. It's not in the abstract. It can come up anywhere. It's coming to see in those my moments is there craving and wanting in that moment. Want want. And if there is what's that like? See that's where the learning how to live comes in. It's not saying don't crave and don't want because it's bad. You're a bad person. What it's saying is it's an unskillful mental state. It doesn't work. It doesn't bring happiness. It brings suffering to you and to others. And so when the mind is in that state of neediness of wanting don't be in a hurry to rid yourself of it. Slip it under and see what that's like. Is it a nice feeling? If so carry on. Make it even stronger. Accumulate even more. More Fame more money more sex more power more whatever it is you want. More shoes more cars more. I don't know. It can be anything. More meditation accolades. The mind is free to latch onto anything and turn it into a torture Chamber or heaven. Okay so what's the mind like when it's that way? What's the mind like when it isn't that way? When the mind is at peace with the way things are? Again learning happens in some ways. It's not so different from old Pavlov and Skinner because a lot of learning goes on that way. We begin to see this learning is painful. It doesn't produce happiness. That's wisdom. All these religious paths exist because suffering exists. If there was no human suffering would we need religions in churches and synagogues and mosques? I don't think so. We need them because we're suffering a lot. And to some degree they may help. I want to get into that's a big one right? And so how do you learn? It's not to just follow it blindly. It's not a new belief. Buddhists don't believe to not grasp on to things that everything is empty and arises and passes away. Fine. I'm a Buddhist now. I believe it. And however many Buddhists are on the world I feel a sense of belonging. We Buddhists feel that there's no self and we don't believe in grasping. I think at a certain point it won't be very fulfilling. It's just another belief. It's dead. It doesn't have much liberating power if any. In fact it may just do the reverse. And as you begin to see when the mind is content as one of my teachers called it just enough mind rather than not enough mind to see that. So that's a valuable piece of self knowledge. It enables you to learn your way out of certain emotional States that are not working for you. If they are full speed ahead of course the next one is aversion or aggression or angering the extreme violence and killing. What's it like when you're furious? What's it like when you're resentful? Envious? Is that fun? It can be bittersweet. But when you look at it with a sustained look this is not about thinking. Real mindfulness is like an empty clean clear mirror. And when you see what it's like to be in that frame of mind what the body is like what quality of energy is that's like? And what's it like when that's not there? When let's say perhaps there's love or kindness or compassion instead maybe the first one when there is an absence of craving or when you feel just generous and the joy of giving but genuine giving. And so you begin to feel your way or learn your way into ways of reeducating your own mind. And only you can do it. It doesn't come from a book. It comes from reading your own nature. Now the meditation practice which in Buddhism is central is designed to equip the mind so that it's strong stable and clear enough to be able to do this work. Because if the mind has no steadiness my words may sound reasonable to you but you won't be able to do it because as soon as fear comes or something else comes blown away. Well that's true for all of us at the beginning. But it's like any other art. It can be learned. If you want to learn this art do you want to learn how to live? Maybe you're happy the way you're living already. Good. Maybe you just came here out of curiosity or your boyfriend comes here your girlfriend comes here. You're welcome. But that doesn't have much energy. The other toxinoculation has to do with the quality of the mind. That is when the mind is confused dark ambivalent ignorant hesitant. Befuddled bewildered. Because the root problem in the Buddhist teaching is ignorance in the mind. That is the mind is deluded. And that's why it thinks that the more it grasps and accumulates the happier it will be. It really believes that when the mind gets clear and looks at it it sees that that's not so not as a new ideology. You can have lots of stuff and be happy or you can have very little stuff and be happy. That's not the point. The point is what is that quality of mind and what does it produce and what are the consequences whether you call it Karma or cause and effect? If you're willing to see how you actually live you can begin to see those actions verbal and otherwise that are beneficial for you and for others. You can see the ones that aren't. But are you willing to learn? Are you willing to actually learn? Sometimes what that means is seeing mistakes and apologizing. Sometimes it means being very discouraged and seeing my God I thought I was through that one but I guess I'm not. But it's not. To give you a final report card it's to what we're learning is how to live a real life. The only way that I know that life can be real is if we are. If we're real. And so how do you do that? So the scene has to become more and more accurate and clear. To begin with our minds are not clear because we're invested. We have strong likes and dislikes. When the mind is not clear it's not enjoyable. I think we all know that. And so see what that's like when the mind is so confused and makes decisions that it doesn't even have confidence in. And see what it's like when the mind feels clear. Sometimes that mind comes upon you in meditation certainly but it's not limited to meditation. Suddenly life is so much simpler. Someone's hungry you see somebody's sad someone's happy. And it's obvious what to do. Life is not any easier in one sense but the simplicity of it which comes from the clear seeing enables the behavior to be appropriate accurate wise kinder. You can see that that's a big piece of the practice. I want to get questions and answers going but I want to link it a little bit in a small way with what is going on since 911. What I'm about to say is not new because the problem that we have has existed since the time of the Buddha. It exists now and it existed. Who knows? In the Buddhist scheme of things it's a beginningless. Beginning. There isn't some origin of the universe. It's sort of like on and on. When you have something as striking as that unexpected event that occurred where thousands of people who are just helplessly killed. And I don't have to repeat that you all know what it is. It is quite can be. For most human beings it is quite a shock just as an individual shock someone who's in good health suddenly dies and everyone's surprised or some disappointment or just the opposite just something totally unexpected happens. Every moment is a moment to learn about yourself. But this one has tremendous potential. That is because there's so much energy that's trapped in the reactions that come about when something as dramatic as this happens. The tremendous amount of fear the anger the apprehension about the future seeing perhaps how uncomfortable you are with not knowing the future again. Self knowledge never takes a holiday so that whatever happens in addition to it being a social event which the whole planet shares it's an individual event. How are you taking what has happened? Forget about how anyone else has. I've been speaking to really a lot of people for months now not only here but elsewhere. Some people will say I don't feel all the horror and the terror that so many other people do. And I feel bad about that. I said okay that's what you practice with. How do you feel? Well I just feel a little bit neutral. Okay start there. Don't feel you're supposed to feel like someone else selfknowledge is really training and honesty. But it's not that you ever have to tell anyone else. It's you being honest with you which is most important. Even if you lie and do something awful and never get caught no one ever finds out you found out and it forms a residue. And the consciousness perhaps sinks down in the subconscious but it's there and it has a debilitating effect. It's a psychic toxin just like food. That's inappropriate. It can be a toxin for the body. Okay so what is happening elicits very strong reactions. And if you're a person of practice if you are a Yogi you're practicing Dupasana or some other meditation. This is a hard time for everyone. There is no one who is exempt from it. But it can be also a very rich time for you because it can unearth fears and problems that have nothing to do with 911. Many people have seen that fears that they thought they were done with or that they had basically a buried since child but old wounds. If you're willing to practice with it and begin to take a look at what this brings up a lot can be learned in order to do that. Of course the clearer you're seeing is the better. I'm going to go a little bit over if you don't mind but I don't think it will be more than 5 minutes over. I know some of you have a tight schedule. By the way if you have to leave right now I won't be offended. You might have to catch a train or something. It's fine. We have to work with the mind that we have. Some of you are relatively new. Maybe you just walked in and this sounds interesting. You can start practicing right now. It's not to wait until the mind is perfect. Whereas if you have an interest in understanding your life as you live it out understanding here is not just thinking understanding. It's not chronic introspection. We already know how to do that. Many of us do. It's not that it's much fresher and more alive and actually finally enjoyable because it brings energy. You don't get headaches from this one even though sometimes what you see is painful. So we start with a mind that is ill equipped perhaps to do this and we have to do the best we can. I don't know. This is well a few weeks ago I was watching CNN and I saw what we're up against. And actually it was a pretty good metaphor for why meditation exists. And I was watching an interview with an Afghani woman who obviously had suffered a great deal from the Taliban and she was trying to describe the condition situation for women in Afghanistan for the past five years. The interview is there's a question and answer going by but do you know what crawl is? Those of you don't know it crawl is that incessant nonstop ticket tape that keeps going. Osama bin Laden has been founder. A President just receives an award. It keeps going I guess 24 hours a day. I don't know. But every time I turn it on there it is again. And on this occasion and some of it is repeated old stuff. I said hey wait a minute. I heard that ten days ago. I mean someone is asleep here. Get rid of that. In the meantime I've missed 30 seconds of what this pool woman is saying on top of that on the upper right hand where they start showing what's going on in Kandahar bombing. And so there I am and there's an announcer and music and I'm trying to watch. This woman is trying to tell her story. And I'm really interested. And in the meantime the crawl is getting me sort of like I'm looking up there and then conductors are over here with planes. And finally it just occurred to me who designed this. This is insane. I said somebody must think that this is a good way to do things. And I realized of course they do because that's how their normal mind is. I realized this is how our mind is let's say right now maybe this year's more focused here. Hopefully there's something happening and you're aware of it. In the meantime the crawl is always going on. The mind is starting to say blah blah blah blah. Used to be. I will be. That's a lot of baloney. But smile anyway. And then you think that condihar is just happening in the upper right. Then there are images floating through your mind at the same time that you're looking and the crawl and the images and that's the mind we're going through life with meditation exists because that mind exists. And it's sort of like how can at least sometimes turn crawl off? Let Kandahar take a rest and just listen to the woman tell her story without music. And America fights all of this hoopla. Just a simple story of one person asking a question seemed to me that was much more powerful than whoever drummed up that. That's what we're up against by the way. Sometimes people who are new get the idea that what he's saying is that thinking is no good. I'm not saying that thinking is magnificent and necessary and beautiful. It's created so much. It's just that we don't know how to use thinking is using us. It would be as if you have a beautiful car whatever car you like Mercedes I don't know whatever car you like and it's great and you drive it around but then you have to get over a Lake. You don't drive the car into the Lake to get to the other side. The car can do certain things and it can't do certain other things. So you get out of the car and you get on a boat. Do you see where you get it? We're using thinking in areas where it's counterproductive. For example we're trying to measure what's immeasurable to get to the link. It's really quite a big subject. But one of the things that I think the Buddhist saying directly is that you are the world. As you get to know your own mind you're getting to know everyone else's mind too. No matter where you go. If you prick us we bleed. We don't like it when our children are hurt or die. We're afraid to get all we're all humans in back of all the different outfits and cultures and foods and ideologies and all the rest of it. And as you get to know yourself I have found it to be so without any special effort you do start understanding other people better because we're the same to jump a lot of steps to whatever degree. My mind became clearer because I've been looking at what this has evoked in me. It has evoked things in me. And we're not going into my particular biography because it's not important because what's important is what this event has and may in the future bring up for you in those moments when the mind is clear. What I have seen and I'm not telling you to see this and this didn't come from books that I read although I'm sure there's nothing novel or particularly interesting or creative about it. But I saw it myself a lot of it from watching news and listening to people. First of all what becomes really apparent is that there's an enormous gap between technology and wisdom. It's like Grand Canyon wisdom is feeble. I mean planet the level of understanding on the planet the level of maturity of us human beings. We haven't learned how to live together and it seems as if we don't want to spend energy doing that. Our energy has gone in the direction of magnificent technological accomplishments. I'm not saying to stop that but if all the best energy of every generation goes in that direction don't be surprised if we don't understand ourselves because it's not held up as an important value. It just isn't. So children are brought up to become great scientists or technicians or whatever it is. We're not brought up that the quality of your life is supreme really important. You're here to live your life. What is the quality of that life? Not the gross national product. Now that's okay. So education isn't just to get a job. Education should be to understand yourself. It's part of education. So I think that part of the problem is in immense. The wisdom is overwhelmed by technology. We can't handle it. We've created energies that are so far beyond our grasp that we're all in danger. This is not about the Al Qaeda or Taliban that's topical. We're all in this together. It's a planetary problem. And the sooner we see it the better. And our contribution to it is there. And I'm not saying I'm a fanatical 60s piece Nick who we just never recovered from the 60s. I'm not saying that it just seems obvious that it isn't as simple as good guys and bad guys that to some degree each one of us has contributed to what's going on. If we still have lots of greed and craving we want lots of things and if we want lots of things that have to come from somewhere and we need the energy and we want it. And then parts of the world the energy comes from there. And in the process all kinds of imbalances are developed. Like we have to have oil from the Middle East in order to do what we like to do. And we don't want to be deprived of that. That's an individual thing. And someone would say well we should get out of Saudi Arabia but you'll have to turn your thermostats down to 60. Well I don't know. I mean Saudi Arabia looks pretty good to me. They like us. They can't say it publicly. So I hear anyway the gap between the massive power of technology and the lack of development in us as individuals selfknowledge and extend that to the race the human race. I feel it comes down to something like this. It's not that I want you to believe this. It's that find out what you see. This came out of some seeing. What I see is that the power of the media has created helped create in a dramatic way a global economy. And everyone's talking about that how wonderful it is. But when you look at the media it's very clear what's going on. It's not to me it's that we have a global economy but we don't have a global consciousness. Consciousness is tribal still and that includes us if you have a better word sectarian nationalistic so that you have people we're all in each other's faces through the media and through the global economy. But consciousness is not the kind of consciousness that can live in a global economy because we're still mired in tribal mentality where it's all about me and everyone's doing it. I'm not singling out America. The United Nations is a bunch of self interested individual countries jockeying for power and influence and veto this and that. So certain people are rubbing up. Cultures are rubbing up against each other. They're not ready for it. They don't understand them. We don't understand. And yet we keep coming together and coming together. There has to be a commensurate development of consciousness. And so when you work on yourself as an individual this may sound really utopian and maybe it is but personally I'm going to do it anyway even if it doesn't help the world. I am doing it. I hope as you work on because greed hatred and delusion we can see it in our own individual life. But the world is an extension of that. Countries get greedy and countries get angry and countries solidify and countries simplify reality. I just want to leave it at that. So in working on yourself you are in some even if it's tiny way contributing. Planting a seed if you will for a world where we go deeper. Because right now we're living in such superficialities we are willing to do business with each other but we take the most superficial aspect of the person to be what's real. It isn't what's really real. Anyone who's meditated knows that when you go deep you're not a Jew or an Arab or even a Buddhist for goodness sakes. When the mind is clear there's no name tag for it there's no brand name there's no label or slogan that applies. It's just there's being is there. And it's wonderful. And it's not that we have to abandon our particular country and ethnic group and that adds the color to the life. But it doesn't have to be held with such ferocity and such making. We're so identified with the surface of what's going on because we haven't gone deep enough into ourselves that if everyone's doing that and it's so great that we have a global economy but we have a provincial mind how can that work? And so I would say maybe it's self serving because I'm in the business but self understanding is what's really called for now. There's a shortage not of energy but of understanding and that's for all of us. We don't understand ourselves as a planet. And all the conferences and legislation and peace treaties they're helpful. I'm not against doing sensible things. They just are so weak and feeble because the mind States haven't changed. Just look at what happened to the Communists even if you like. It a good ideology but people were just the same people and it didn't work. The inner is much more powerful than the outer. Finally okay I'll get down from my soapbox but it's not. Please I really sincerely beg of you. I am not trying to convince you of any political ideology or whether you should be for the war against the War protests. Let the clarity of your own mind help you know how to behave from here on in because if what's been said is so it's not over it's going to unfold and there are going to be more challenges. The practice should help you live in the midst of those challenges by developing some more wisdom so that even though we're all challenged you're not overwhelmed by what happens. Okay. If anyone has to leave please and let's start the questioning in. Let's give it a minute or two. Go ahead.

And the younger one seemed really angry. And I stopped looking at me. And then another friend of theirs drove up on a bicycle. And while they were distracted I just walked away. But they followed me and they kept throwing snowballs at me. And they hit me with a good one in the back of the head. And I was angry. And I turned around and said something like grow up or something. And then I just walked home. But I was really angry. And that experience on and off has been with me since. And I don't know how to respond. Yeah I don't want to tell you how but let's say here's what. How practice can help for the big stuff. And this is a relatively small thing but it's still going to happen. And who knows? It could have become a dangerous thing. Your reactions were just that. There were mechanical reactions. You can't help it. You're conditioned that way. And you felt invaded however you felt. So what you said to them came out of that mind. It has a whole different energy. The energy has the energy of being annoyed intruded upon who do you think you are? Maybe a little frightened and so forth. That's what they feel. Okay. The practice is being aware of what is being aware of how you took crowding and hot. You see you're irritated. Okay. Now when you become aware and you can get better at this with practice your reflexes become much more quick. The awareness slips in under this kind of thing. And it can happen eventually lightning fast it falls away and the mind is clear. And I don't know what you should say although I can make up a few things that I hope I might. I don't know if I would say it but out of the clear mind you have a much better chance of answering or not answering in a way that's skillful and wise. For example here's another one that maybe your mind didn't think of because of conditioning. And I'm not saying I could do it but it did occur to me as you were speaking especially when the kid hit turn around and say hey that's a great shot. Terrific. In other words you use Aikido instead of fighting them you join them. It's like frivolous. It's a winter Wonderland. Hey that was terrific. Whoa that's a good shot. But I'm not offering that as a formula as a recipe. Like next time do that. I'm saying out of clear mind can come surprising responses not react. Reactions are mechanical and typically don't help because the energy is very different. When the mind is clear there's a much better chance the response of being adequate appropriate and actually helpful. Again no guarantees. Yes. Is everyone clear on that? And that's why self knowledge it helps you live. It really helps because you can save yourself a lot of wear and tear not getting angry at everything that happens to you. After all who got angry? Your sense of being separate and having a right to your space and walking and going home and not being whatever blah blah. As you see that that starts to fall away in practice. It gets lighter thinner more transparent and the snowball hits emptiness. It isn't experience it's that big a deal. Or the reaction becomes much weaker. Yeah. I think years ago before I started to meditate I would have had a bigger reaction bigger might have even gotten into some real problem with these kids. It sounds like you almost did. Yeah. But little less than maybe a few years ago. Right. The Dallas have a very nice way of putting it. That is if you're in a boat going down the river and another boat crashes into you but there's no one in it. You don't get angry but if there's someone in it you get furious.

Think I'm mindful for a millisecond or something. What's your advice about using thoughts? I know. So if I'm meditating and thinking about myself do I stay with that thought and be thoughtful about myself? Should it be all back to the breath like that's? A thought and so let it go. I'm sure there's a transition over time to something else. Okay if you're sure then I don't have to answer. First of all let's be clear what mindfulness is. There's no thinking in mindfulness. Otherwise it's not what we're talking about. Now you can be mindful of something and thoughts are going on but they're not in any way hampering the clear seeing. So it's not like you have to stamp out thought but the thoughts don't have that compelling quality. Now with practice especially as you start knowing the difference between thinking and everything else. Right now the mind to begin with is quite confused because one very important chapter of self knowledge has to do with understanding the role of thought in life and to see how limited it is that in its proper place it's magnificent. But we have equated it with living itself. We have given a tremendous authority probably many if not most of us all I know everyone in this room makes a living from thought. You're probably good at it in some realm. Okay it's not to stop that but all spiritual life the real religious mind. This is not particularly Buddhist but the Buddha is very perhaps unique. I don't know enough about all the religions to leave a clear roadmap and clear methods to do it. The religious mind is to go beyond all this. In other words that's the immeasurable that I mentioned earlier on. Now all you can do is if I tell you something I don't think it's very helpful. All you can do is begin to pay attention to how you live. Now there is a form of insight that's kind of still helpful and it's not just for beginners. It's called reflective insight. And that's where seeing and reason and logic and intelligence putting two and two together is useful. And then there's direct insight. The direct insight is uncommon. Probably you don't have that unless you learn how to do it. And that's why we're here. The reflective insight. Probably everyone in this room already knows how to use it and it can be refined where you get a sense of things. Let's say you see the World Trade Center the towers go down. From that point on many people have a deeper understanding of the impermanent nature of life. And it's mixed with thought. Some people let's say if you see it and it goes so deeply into the heart that it goes well beyond the World Trade Center. When you start to realize even without the World Trade Center it's always been like that. Everything is impermanent and doesn't have an enduring core. It's empty of an autonomous self. So there are different levels of depth of insight. The deepest comes from a scene that has nothing to do with previous accumulations. Meaning thinking knowledge and so forth. That doesn't mean it's worthless. And on the way what you're saying is useful too. Sure but practice mindfulness as best you can. Use it in simple ways. It's not finally about the breath. The breath is there to help you be mindful. It's about being mindful about what's going on. Take simple activities like the dishes and make it a meditation. You're washing the dishes and notice the mind. And then you just gently come back. Just gently come back and just do the dishes. And let that extend out to more complicated matters which are of course more difficult. And the snowball thing is more complicated because there's a threat involved. And we know what teenagers are capable of now and who knows what it could lead to. But you have to start where you are. Otherwise it would be an impersonation. But what you're doing is not a waste of time. Not at all.

So I wonder if you could tell us. It's not that I have nothing to hide about that. It's that we're here to help you understand how you do it. Well I gave you one. I told you that by following my own reactions the mind became quiet. And I saw that this is a world problem. It's a planetary problem and that all of us are contributing to it by having minds that are not contemporary with the way the world is now. The mind is still tribal. That's the best term I can come up with. And the world is changing so fast that boundaries are all intermingling and we don't know what to do with it. The Soviet Union falls apart and suddenly you have everything endless ethnic groups emerging with pride and flags and foods and fighting and all. Whereas what the world needs is not that and begin to understand. Like let's say if you get critical of what the President's doing or what's going on take a look and look into yourself. For example if you're kind of patriotism let's say personally I'll go this far. I love the United States. I come from an immigrant background. I know what my parents have been through. I inherited their suffering in other countries. And America has been incredibly good to me. I have no words for it. I did serve in the military blah blah blah. But all I'm trying to say is that it doesn't. And I'm Jewish. It doesn't stop me. But it's taken work over the years. I have a deep love of Israel. I can't help it. It's conditioned. But for a while now I honestly feel tremendous sympathy for the Palestinians. And I hear the Israelis argument is so onesided. It's like they produce something and then they complain as to why they get hit back. But then the Palestinians are doing it as well. It's like neither of them can be happy unless the other one is. And all they do is so that I'm able to let's say love this country but not set it up in such an exclusive way that I can't hear what certain Arab thoughts are certain criticism of what's going on and try to weigh it. Even the bad guy Osama bin Laden I've tried to listen to what he's saying. Some of his critique is not insane. The solution is not as it may be. And him as a person is not that interesting to me. So if you're willing to everything that's going on reveals something about yourself. So in some ways I'm contributing to it by let's say if I'm marching around with the flag and I've seen it in Harvard Square where someone was doing a political thing and this was within the first two weeks they didn't have an American flag. And someone came over. It wasn't even about Pacifism. It was about a different political candidate in next election. And I said Well Where's your American flag? You never served in the military. I saw the beginnings of a fight. And I looked at this person I said I'm a vet. And how come you and so that kind of American stuff is not helping anyone and that's part of what has contributed to it. And then we're all doing it to each other. So if you can liberate yourself and of course the Buddhist teaching us no matter what you say it's always like start with you I will say something this may sound. I hope it doesn't sound conceited to me. It's something that grows out of practice. There is hope. The period prior to this happening and for a while prior has been an extremely happy one for me and it has not been interfered with by this. There's just a tremendous ongoing joy. It comes from meditation quite honestly. And I also like my life but I also have experienced sorrow. They both can coexist. The sorrow has been sometimes about the low level at which the human race is steep. It's not abstract to me. It's sort of like how can we do this to each other? Okay so there's a certain depth of something that doesn't get pushed around by the event and all of us have it. That's the point of what the Buddha is saying. There's something in us that's stronger than anything that happens to us. Whatever name I won't name it for right now whether you call it Buddha nature original nature and it's accessible to begin to taste it. Okay. That doesn't mean you become like a stone. If anything it's more poignant. You become more sensitive to cruelty and so forth. And both are coexisting inside of me. But there's a foundation that doesn't seem to be budge. That doesn't seem to budge if you think that's egocentric. I'm not saying I'm big and light and guy I'm just trying to describe something.

I had moments this fall and I think given 911 it makes a lot of sense in some way. Some of what you were talking about kind of these moments I'll be on the botister on the T where my own finitude will really strike me. And kind of it sounds a little bit dramatic and silly to put in the language but I've had this for the last several years and it's definitely increased over the last year and it's accelerated even more this past auto. And on the one level I know it's an opportunity. For what I just want to make sure what I hear you saying is more and more you're starting to recognize deeply the obvious truth that you're going to die. Now what? And yet I find that I get very scared in that moment and not really able to go too much further with it. There's nothing next because you want to solve the problem by going farther. You're not facing the fear. Do you see what I'm getting at? The practice is so exquisitely simple minded. If you remember this it applies to almost anything you can tell me. It doesn't mean you don't act because you have to often act and you do the best you can like with the snowball or whatever it is. But if death has brought up fear that means you're alive. And the Buddha has intentional contemplations to accomplish that. We don't need that right now because this event has made it more authentic in a way than any in a sense artificial reflection which then brings up fear. But do you have a practice? Do you do this practice or something like it? Yeah. So then the fact that fear comes up is fine then practice with it and don't get invested. Well I still have a little bit of fear left. I have a little bit less take it from moment to moment. Life keeps liberate yourself from this moment because in the moment when you're afraid but you're not awake you're enslaved. In the Buddhist sense you're attached. You're enslaved. But in a breath. If you wake up and meet the fear with openness and receptivity that doesn't mean it's not going to still be fearful. It will. But it's a very different experience. When the fear is experienced consciously you do that a few more times and fear becomes workable. You begin to see oh fear is just fear. It's no more than that. Then you start to begin to see well how come I'm so afraid? You'll see that it grows out of thinking right now you're not dying. I mean except in a profound way we all are. And so that you've had thoughts about your impending death at some time in the future. Now the reason I said now what? Because if you just bring up the fear of death and you don't do anything creative or useful with it then what's the point. You've just made your life more frightening. And it's not wisdom or liberation. Do you see what I'm getting at? Don't think of liberation as some Stephen Spielberg special effect. Sometimes there are breakthroughs that happen in meditation that are quite dramatic. But most of it is blue collar labor. And there's a moment of freedom a moment of slavery and just take it one moment at a time. In the moment insight meditation is the practice of liberation. In a moment of either grasping or pushing away you're not free. If you pay attention you'll see what it feels like. But again if you suddenly see how you're holding on what that feels like it tends to loosen and you're still afraid. But it has a different energy altogether. Please. Nothing special except that it's a powerful object. Let's say fear comes okay? Throw the word fear out. There's an energy that's there. And you could feel it coursing through the body right there's. Very strong bodily sensations. If you're afraid it's not vague. The heart the posture changes. Well you know that's available. Go right to that with mindfulness. And then the mind will start churning out thoughts that are all disabling. You're going to die. You'll be crippled. It's hopeless. They're ideas. They're just thoughts. Now with practice you can begin to see that they're just thoughts. And if you can attend to the energy of the fear with mindfulness that means sustain seeing. And at first that's hard to do because we're afraid to look at fear. Most people never begin. They're lowered into the grave with fear. I'm afraid whoops I didn't mean to be clever but it's true. I'm not really afraid of that. But what I've seen in the people that I've worked with and myself unless you get fed up with fear and that is a piece of self knowledge you begin to see the price you're paying for fear how it cripples you cuts off all kinds of creativity prevents you from taking certain risks that could be creative and useful. And you begin to see that it's quite a steep price that we pay for allowing fear to control us. But then there's an incentive to gently softly start inching towards it. And it's the same practices with the breathing it's to receive it as it is. It's just energy. See what I'm getting at? Okay. That's the purest and the most direct way. And at first it'll be hard because there'll be resistance. You'll be afraid to look at fear or you hate it. And then so you look at that. You look at how much energy there is in not wanting to look at fear. You heard what I said. Did you understand my words just now? Seriously it's the question okay? And let's say fear comes up and you say Great it sounded good up in that hall. But now the last thing I want to do is take a look at my fear. Then take a look at that. Take a look at how much you don't want to look at fear at resistance. You'll feel the body. It's not about fear now. It's contraction in the face of fear. And then little by little you learn your way into how to you see fear is workable because it's observable. If it weren't observable be hopeless. It isn't hopeless but it's just like any other art the art of cooking the art of painting. It's putting things in the right place. Fear has a proper place in life. Sometimes it's quite intelligent and saves us. But a lot of it the fear we're talking about now is neurotic fear. There isn't a real threat in this moment. It's not doing you any good. It's just exhausting.

It's just going to overwhelm. That's an idea isn't it? But it's a very convincing one. You believe in it but who makes overwhelming? How do you cut out of the cycle of me? Firstly you've concluded that's overwhelming and then you find it. Well I was right. It is. It's a one woman show. You're playing all the roles. You see what I'm getting at? That's what we're all doing. It's Marcel Marceau. If you don't know you're doing a whole thing. But now I'm not trying to force your head into the fear. You get into that fear and you look at it. If you're a Yogi not saying that you can be gentle but it does take a certain courage at the beginning and an incentive an interest in wanting to really understand this so you can be free of fear or at least weaken it. I've seen people with horrible panic attacks horrible learn how to disarm them and they're not doing it. It's the same old boring vapasna technique. Nothing new. It's just that what you're being asked to be mindful of is not something you want to be mindful of. And it's a rough one but it too can be learned. So let's reenact it. Oh my God this is overwhelming. Start right there. Forget about fear. Just realize that you've already concluded that this is hopeless and it may be so big that right now your awareness isn't ready for it. There may be an element of truth in what you're saying and so that's why the Shamata or concentration practice is also so important. Do you know what I mean by that? Okay. Have you worked with the breath in an exclusive way that concentrates the mind and that makes the mind more fit strong steady. It needs to be the breath. There are many many ways but you take one thing and you come back to it again and again and again. Okay? Out of that the mind starts becoming more steady. And so then you won't be as likely to feel overwhelmed because probably it's true. Your mindfulness is a baby mindfulness. You haven't done so much of it and certainly not with fear. And so it is easily overwhelmed. So it's both in a way that as you start little by little approaching it and seeing that maybe it's workable. But also see every time you're mindful that's what gets stronger not just on the cushion. You mindfully do the dishes. You're taking a walk into the square and you're aware of the experience of moving. Every time you mindfully hear a bird chirp the car stops because it's a red light and you're with three or four breaths until the light becomes green and you drive. All of that contributes to refashioning and reshaping the mind so that it is able to do the things that I'm talking about. It's not like you walk in here you hear this rap and then like far out man and you just do it. This is not a quick fix. This practice is for adults. What the Buddha is saying is you're responsible for your own happiness. And we are being given the tools both in terms of teachings and also techniques to enable the mind to be up to the task of looking at itself. Because to begin with it probably isn't. One last one please. Sure. The concentration of the mind is very important. Yes. So otherwise the mind gets overheld. Yes. Anything. I have retired by the way last time I saw it was like maybe 50 years ago. Patricia Barry. Yes. I don't know. I feel like the same jerk. I'll stop it. Let me be playful. For God I don't think I'm a jerk. I've also gotten older for goodness sake. 15 years of living on this strange planet will mellow anyone. Maybe the practices help some too. Yeah but what about you? Well we're talking about you now. I was doing that very soon daily and whatever and then suddenly problem with this concentration. And that was the same problem. I told you that 15 years ago. When I tried to concentrate and I am very much with my rising falling and feeling sensations in my nose it seems like this second and it sounded so there's no clarity. I got sleepy and it's just oh I don't see anything. It's very improductive. So I had to talk to her at that time and I told her that. I wonder what I was saying now. And it's probably the same old thing. But look it's hard for me to respond to what you're saying because. No for the following reason everyone I know when you begin you do run into how wild mind is. There's no question about that. Now first of all some of it is not your fault. Sometimes the practice is conveyed as if what's really important and real is retreats and sitting maybe walking. Okay that's useful too. But then 99% of our life is what's left over. How long can you sit on the cushion? Or how often can you go to Barry? The quality of mine that I'm talking about that's adequate to face the fear that you're talking about or whatever sadness loneliness whatever it is to get free is not just developed in sitting. It's developed in life itself just naturally by more and more paying attention. But if you're not interested in taking that on as something worth doing it's not going to get stronger. Look is there something in life that you love to do? Let me just continue about same thing. Well after I couldn't do it well by sitting I just kind of let go. And I lived my life day to day just to be as much mindful as possible but continuously. And I just like to be whatever it is. And this morning I was afraid of my meditation. I'm trying to hard but just let it happen. So it seems like it's easier doing a moment to moment for your daily life. Then sitting makes my mind very sleepy or unclear unproductive. And I kind of stopped reading Krishnamurchi. I said why? He said all I would say that it doesn't work. So I said myself I just have to do it continuously. And now after several years I came here and I'm listening and I have been starting sitting again. And I think maybe don't make such a big deal out of it. Yeah but I think you just said it. If you don't. Wait a minute. It's not this kind of thing. It's one useful skill in life to take the breathing let's say and stay with it and come back to it and come back to it. It doesn't have to be either or either. It's daily. By the way many people have a very hard time in daily life and they get really good at just so everyone's different. Now if you'd come to an interview one thing that I think would be helpful would be ease up a little bit. You're trying too hard. What is it that and there may be fear that's often when we get sleepy a lot we're afraid of going deeply because we're afraid of what's there. I'm not saying it's true of you. I don't know you. Yeah. Some kind of unusual things going through my head like I heard voices and some lights and all kinds of things. Did you ever bring it to a teacher? I was in a monastery sitting. Did you bring it to a teacher there? There was no one there. Okay. But let's say if you brought it to what they would do. I was afraid by myself. Okay. But look the instructions are no different. Whether it's lights or it's this or whatever you want to tell me watch it rise and pass away. There are extraordinary things that happen to you when you get very concentrated and the medicine is all the same. They're all illusions from a profound point of view. Dogs turn into cats then turn into rabbits and you feel like the body has disappeared. You feel like you're not breathing anymore. No one dies. From these things and it's the same instruction is that this is the scenery. It's just that I've never been here before. Fine. Get to know it. Maybe it's like a country you've never been to. But look this can go on and on. The fact that you're doing daily life is wonderful. Keep doing that and ease back into the sitting. Sounds like you already have doing that. And just do a bit each day and don't make such a do or die thing out of it. Or it's like this says whether I'm really a meditator or I'm not really. But let me ask you the daily life mindfulness has that made a beneficial has it had a beneficial effect? Yes you should tell me that. So you think we're all spiritual. Okay. But it's about you. If you have a lot of people who support you great. If you don't then there are other. Look there were years when I have no support. Then you develop other qualities like self reliance. And then when you have the support of a community that's wonderful. Take advantage of it because life is both together and alone. But finally whether it's Atlanta or the moon you know it's you and you. And if the door of daily life has opened up to you which it sounds like wonderful that's great. And now slowly bring sitting in it. But finally have you ever heard the proof of the pudding is in the eating? It's an American or Western cliche. The proof of the pudding whether the pudding is good or not is not in the ingredients or what you look at or smell it's in the eating. Okay. So if it's helping you to get free wonderful. If you're still going round and round around I would question and see. What do you mean by sitting? What do you mean by mindfulness and daily life? But it sounds like what you're doing is useful. So just keep doing it. And do you do retreats from time to time? What they're too far away in your own home? Take an afternoon or a day. You asked me if I'm mindful. I probably that Ouch. But you said it gets too painful so I got to be mindful when I travel. I saw it staying hostile and aversion to this and that and it's painful. So I'm very mindful of the mindfulness. Help you live in a situation that helped me? Yeah. Okay. They are very strong. I don't know how I would deal with that. Do fears come up for you? No I don't want to be abstract. Do fears come up for you? Look our practice is with what's there. It's the same instruction for sadness. It's not a new one. Could we have a few moments of silence please? What I mean by the proof of the pudding is in the eating is that whether you do the breath or you do a mantra or you do mental notes or you do a Con or you sit for three months or you shave your head or you grow a beard or you eat meat or you don't eat meat or just endless forms that you may finally are you getting free of your suffering? If you are good there are just lots of different ways to do it. 331 house is one way to do it. I have no illusions. This is not good for everyone. I hope it's useful to at least some of you if it is full speed ahead. If it's not keep searching find a different method different technique different teachers.

Yes we're all going to practice Donna parameta from the moment we wake up until we go to sleep. But we won't be able to because what happens is these old impulses reinstate themselves and color everything. So it's not that we have to be perfect. What we can do though is we can begin to learn from our actual reactions. And that's why the force of generosity is called a purification of mind. Any moment that you practice this you're reconditioning your mind in a beneficial way. When you practice greed then you're making that stronger. Hoarding you're strengthening that just even a moment even a thought about it for example just to reflect. And this is a reflection in Buddhist practice people will sometimes go on retreats and take some time. Some Tibetan practices are like this where you reflect on past occasions when you were generous. It's not to kind of Pat yourself on the back and build up your ego. It's just to acknowledge how joyful it was to be generous how you enjoyed your friends came over and you have this meal in the refrigerator. But okay let's share it. And you had a great time. So you reflect on past moments when you were generous and you allow yourself to reexperience the generosity. And the deeper Samadhi or concentration you mix your Samadi in with that recollection. What you do is in those mind moments you're now giving yourself the inner feeling of the joy of generosity which then makes it easier for actual generosity in the now to be forthcoming. So what you're doing is a good practice? Sure. Please. It's the same thing if I hear you correctly or understand you. For some people receiving is giving. That is if you don't allow. I don't know if it'll be funny now but you know who the Lone Ranger is. Okay it's not important. I'll explain who he was my childhood hero when I was growing up there was a man. He had a white horse and he wore a mask and he had a cowboy outfit and he had an assistant who was an Indian. What? This is radio honey. Okay so this man was the Loan Ranger. And the Loan Ranger would constantly be doing good things. He would just save this person and donate this. But when people wanted to thank him he would always ride off and they would say who was that? He's gone. And finally one of the episodes I remember and it just struck me as hilarious where people got really furious. You're always riding off. You never let us thank you. Later on Lenny Bruce who was a comedian made an extended very good thing out of that. And so in some way he's not allowing the people who he's helped to express their appreciation. And this is a common thing let's say in relationship where sometimes the way to give someone something is to allow to receive. Is that what you're getting at? Yeah. That's why finally it's a subjective thing. It has to do with the inner meaning for you. It's not out there exactly.", 'human_start_time': '1:21:13'}, {'talkname': '19890419-Larry_Rosenberg-UNK-dana_the_flowering_of_generosity-1565', 'question_num': 'Question 2', 'url': '/talks/1565/19890419-Larry_Rosenberg-UNK-dana_the_flowering_of_generosity-1565.mp3', 'display_name': 'Dana: The Flowering Of Generosity', 'date': '4/19/89 0:00', 'start_time': 5155310, 'content': "But also and you are giving their way.

And somehow I tend to understand these things and then you have to deal with the person's psychology. What is it? You're christianing them. From the heart. On whose part? The donor or the recipient? Okay. Yeah we're not perfect yet. And so whatever it is it's all right. It's moving in the right direction. This seems to be an evening for Sansanim stories. A number of us started as a center in New York City. And at the opening of it many Korean people came really a lot and they've brought flowers for the altar which is a custom in Buddhist for Buddhist temples to signify impermanence. Flowers wilt and die. They're beautiful you appreciate them and then they die. It's a teaching. And these Korean people brought plastic flowers on the altar and there were a number of us. I remember one person in particular who had very strong sense of aesthetics. He was a poet. He's now a very famous poet. And when no one was looking we'd whisk them away and hide them under the clothes. And then these Korean women would find them and just put them back out again or there would be more abroad. And we did it a few times and finally we went to Sansense. We have this beautiful new temple and they keep putting all these plastic flowers and we were complaining and he says these women have very pure hearts. He said your mind is made of plastic. Many of the monks part of their job is especially the very mature ones. Part of their job is to provide people with an object who receives things but they don't need anything. For example it's quite common. I'm just thinking about our time is running out. Ajian Chah who some of you have read you've read his book. So there was an American Monk who had an interest in art and he saw all these wonderful works of art being donated to a Jung Cha and being brought to his little meditation HUD. And at one point it became his turn to clean up AAJan Cha's heart and he was very excited because he wanted to see all this great art. He came into the hut it was totally empty. All it was there was a cot and mosquito netting and totally empty. The same with Mahabhuas. Mahabu is one of my teachers. He's given things. It's like a Department store after some of the piles of you name it and you go into his Coote or his little house and all I saw was a jar of medicine and a map and a cot and mosquito netting. So apparently what's happening is people are giving them. Thank you very much. They give it someone else. People give them money. Thank you very much. So they're a medium a means for the person to practice on to develop generosity. But they don't need it. It would be stupid for them to just pile it up when they don't use it. So they then just recycle it just as with the extra food. Okay maybe one last one and then call it an evening if there is anything on anyone's mind. Sure. Okay do it. Just a final few words about this center and Donna this center totally exists because of Donna. This by the way is not a pitch for collection or anything. As I was talking it reminded me of the synagogue days where at the end suddenly we get quiet and then the Rabbi would talk about what was needed and all the donations and so forth. I don't think that's what I'm doing. Maybe unconsciously I am. I hope not. We've wrestled with this. The center itself is supported by donations some large some very small membership et cetera. Most of us who are involved with the Center let's say on the board and people who are teaching here we would love to be able to just give the teachings away free just for you all to just come here whenever you'd like and to leave whenever you'd like. And to be no charge for any classes talks retreats what have you and just leave it up to you. But the problem is it's a very practical one is that we have to pay our bills on a monthly basis. And in the west you don't have that notion. In fact why should you? The practice is too new here. It hasn't been here long enough for you have to derive the fruit with such depth that you out of your own spontaneity want to support the place. I mean we don't want to have to be saying well you know if you don't give us money we can't pay the rent or whatever it is or we can't pay our electric bill which would be more like it. And so since most of us are very new to Dharma and we haven't fully have time to experience what it is the preciousness of what it is that we're doing here we can't wait for you to kind of develop that. And so we have another option which is also used in Asia which is to me a perfectly wholesome one. And that is sharing the expenses. And that's IMS those of you know IMS is a mixture. That is you pay a certain fee which covers the running of IMS. But then whatever you give to teachers is up to you. Here we try to keep the prices as low as we can within the limits of us surviving as an organization with costs. And I hope you see it that way also. No one has to my knowledge has ever been turned away because of money either to be a member or to do a retreat. So we tried to in our own way balance that by we need a certain standard amount of money on a monthly basis so that the center can operate smoothly. And then again we're not here to make this an enormous profit making venture. And so we try to stay pretty close to that. But the spirit is similar and it's and we ourselves.", 'human_start_time': '1:25:55'}, {'talkname': '20011121-Larry_Rosenberg-CIMC-self_knowing_a_quiet_passion_2-8728', 'question_num': 'Question 1', 'url': '/talks/8728/20011121-Larry_Rosenberg-CIMC-self_knowing_a_quiet_passion_2-8728.mp3', 'display_name': 'Self Knowing - A Quiet Passion (2)', 'date': '11/21/01 19:30', 'start_time': 4309150, 'content': "And also this analogy that is a soft garden.

It's not that from that softness comes to strength. The words are going to be inadequate because this is inconceivable. The whole point of this place is the thinking mind is not there. So you can use words like silent mind the cognizing power. These are different words that people use. But experientially. I'll do my best because it also can sound like there's no news. You don't give a damn about the other people in the world. It doesn't mean that at all. What I can tell you what little I know of it is that when it's tapped there's no you there. You is not allowed. No ego is allowed. You can't get it because as long as you're trying to by definition the big noise maker is me. This is a place of spaciousness and silence. Now when we hear words like that then it sounds like it's just a break. It's extraordinarily rich. My words are going to be inadequate. But when you tap it even for a little while some of how you know what it is is afterwards. First of all it's very fulfilling to be there. There's no confusion about that. You can feel that you've entered a dimension. It's not a place it's not here. You've entered a dimension which is a dimension that has been unknown to you. It's totally new and it seems to have a certain intelligence there. It's not rational or logical. Let me skip ahead. You find yourself being much more loving and compassionate and wise for having tap this place. Not because you've cultivated take meta loving kindness. Do you know that practice okay. For those of you we do a practice here where you cultivate kindness. May I be happy may I be peaceful and then you send it to other people. You're trying to develop a certain quality. Maybe you feel you don't have enough love and you can do it with compassion et cetera. That's cultivated. That is you trying to improve. You okay. When you tap this place the compassion is intrinsic that's magical at this point I definitely joined the Mystics. I have no idea what's going on. Whether you want to call it God or awakening or original nature or true nature there are endless words for it. The Holy Spirit. I don't know what to call but it's not vague. And you're not cheated. Now when you taste that even for a little while. Whatever suffering is out there you see it. When the mind is quiet the heart can hear it's. Not just with these things. You see much more deeply the suffering. And at first that can be a problem. But the practice can also. The strength you're asking about isn't this kind of strength. See these images? We're taking worldly images inner riches. What does that mean? That we have gold piled up in snow? I have to use something that we respect that's out here to kind of help us grasp that we have a treasure house in here. But even the word treasure house. Okay it's a jewel. Then we go. So no matter what I say but the strength is that this place is safe from everything. It doesn't rise and pass away. It's not vulnerable but it's not stone. I give up. But let's put it this way. You will feel like you're a more stable person. You'll feel like in the midst of pain that's going around with everyone that you have some strength. There's something stronger than the event. But you're not obdurate. You're not hardened or callous to the event. You're open to the event. You're sensitive to it. Sensitive discerning. But you're not overrun by that sensitivity. Sensitive.

It made me more committed to my own spiritual work. So that I just feel that there's a greater potential for awakening in this country than the way things were before. I think there are people who do feel that way and that is for example taken on an individual level and also on a cultural level when something challenges us so radically. That's what I meant. The deeper the threat the greater the possibility for growth. Okay but you have to recognize it and do something with it. So our culture the planet for example. This is just my big fat opinion everything I said tonight. But anyway we keep talking about the global economy and that's a good thing. Not everyone thinks that but most global economy free trade and all that. But we don't have a global consciousness to match the global economy. So we think happiness is in more trade and then we'll all have what better more objects better cars? We already have that. We know it's not enough. That's why America is the spiritual capital of the planet because we've already gone there. We've seen like it's great to have a lot of stuff but it ain't enough. What needs to happen if it can something like this perhaps this is an optimistic twist on it. Is that out of the desperation of seeing what we've created but we have to start seeing it that we're all in this together. It's not east versus Islam. All that stuff is the dualism you're talking about. We've all created it together. We have to begin to see that. And there is the possibility of learning of movement. So it needn't be hopeless because sometimes it takes a big blow to wake up. So this could be something where we start to recognize that we've all helped create each other. And we all need each other and the global consciousness and global economy. Because otherwise what you have is we're in each other's face. But we don't have a global consciousness. Tv and travel everyone's and goods. Now everything that's circulating. But it's still the same tribal mind. We all have the same tribal mind. Me you. Every day there's like a new ethnic group. Now I got to know the past June but before that it was Becky's. I don't care about California but I got to know about how the Kazakhstans are doing now. And each one has its own pride in our culture and our dishes and our dances and our outfits and our dignity. I'm sort of like Holy mackerel. Everything's becoming one. Just endless proliferation of ethnic groups that doesn't have to disappear. But the ferocity with which it's held. How can you have a global consciousness when everyone is so provincial so tribal and yet the goods are going around but we don't have mind. It's an invitation for trouble. Do you see what I'm getting at? So when you work on yourself that it sounds utopian and no doubt it is. You're doing peace work. Anytime you can become less violent less judgmental et cetera have a bigger consciousness so that you understand that this is all superficial. Arabs and Jews that's just like outer garments. We're all human. If we can only connect with that you can still be a Jew and an Arab. You can still be Buddhist and Christian. That's not necessarily suffering unless you grasp onto it you see. And that's one of the most dangerous perhaps the most dangerous attachment in the Buddhist terms. It's one of the hardest things to get free of attachment to views and opinions. The terrorists had it. They really felt they had a monopoly on the truth. No doubt they were happy believing they're going to heaven with virgins dancing around. And for them it's true. And they're willing to keep you know. So the most dangerous thing if you read history have been religious ideologies. When you get fanaticism under the flag of religion get out of the way. It's impossible because people feel they have God on their side. Okay now so it's not the ethnic groups or the religions per se. That's the problem. But this provincial and bring it down to our level. We're doing it with each other in our families. Why can't we live together? Why can't we be at peace with each other? Because we're like the countries are me my ego. You said that. So it's the same dynamic. So as you liberate yourself you're contributing to all of us getting free because we make up the world. We are the world. Does that make sense? Okay please.

Does everyone know what Mudita practice? No. It's joy in the good fortune of others. So you're using that to balance out what jealousy. Right. And I'm trying to learn what resources I have for myself to end a conflict with someone who I have unconditional love towards and trying to figure out what my part can be in ending the conflict or making things better. Good question. That's getting right at it. Mudita and meta. They're cultivated practices. You're trying to develop a quality that you feel maybe isn't strong enough. That's useful. But it's not going to uproot jealousy. It will kind of soften jealousy a bit. Let's say jealousy is like this. It's a bit like Adolf tenderizer. I don't know if that exists anymore. It's something you put used to. I haven't eaten meat in a long time but I'm vegetarian. I just want. I'm a nice person passive as vegetarian. So that if there's a way of cultivating joy in the good fortune of others rather than oh boy I should have had that. And if the jealousy is strong that kind of balances it a bit. And it's a positive thing to do but it doesn't uproot the jealousy. So sooner or later you're going to have to look at the jealousy power of insight. That's what Vipostein is about. Don't throw the other out there. They're all tools to help you move towards freedom. Okay. Now you have certain feelings towards another person. The logic of this practice is as unpleasant as it may be. You have to see those feelings. But if you can observe them with a loving eye nonjudgmental. It's sort of like being aware of whatever it is. What would you call it? What would you call it? Whatever it is that you don't like about the attitude you have towards some another person. Right. The other way around. My feeling is unconditional love. Right. Okay. You want something from them that they're not prepared to give to you is that it? But are you playing a role in the conflict? Yes. Okay. So all you can do is take care of your part. Now there's an interesting thing that happens. It's called breaking the circuit. It's in all religions that I know of. The opposite of that is an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. I go like this. You go like that and I kick you. And then you hit me over the head with it. And then we're all toothless and blind. We wonder why is everyone so ugly? Supposing this person is doing their thing. But you've examined the part you're doing but not just thinking but you actually see it and it gets weaker and falls away. Then they do their thing but it isn't met in kind. See that's what Gandhi did. Gandhi returned violence with love. Aggression with love. He wasn't a Patsy obviously. He was firm. Okay. You understand now breaking the circuit. If they do their thing and you don't do your thing. It's like they throw a punch and it's just air. That's what I meant about if either the Israelis or the Palestinians if one of them could just say I'm going to be bigger when they point their finger I'm not going to point mine. I'm just going to stop doing. I'm going to remove the settlements unconditionally no matter what they do. Or do you see what I'm getting at? It gives the possibility for a new dynamic to emerge. No guarantees. Do you see what I'm getting at? Use the practice to help you. You can't live the other person's life for them but you can change the condition so that they have a chance to perhaps rise to the occasion too and meet you.

Yes. I have no idea for sure what that means before I heard that about impermanence. And for some reason I've accepted impermanence and things over a long period of. Time as an idea. Within myself that things that I love were torn down and people die and things like that. And I haven't been practicing great deal for very long. But over years I've felt that way about impermanence. But I also was wondering if you accept impermanence fairly easily. When people are mourning and people are crying maybe about the same things. You wonder if there's a certain insensitivity or coldness. This is all imagining on your part. Speculation. No being attached to this turning off? No response? I don't think so. First of all let me deepen or add to or amplify what you were saying. Now no matter how much you feel you have understood in permanence because of losses and so forth. The practice of hippasana would be from moment to moment. Let's say when you're sitting seeing that each breath arises and passes away. Each idea in the mind arises and passes away. Each mood comes and go. Sounds come and go. The body is uncomfortable then it's comfortable then you have high energy then low energy and you penetrate to a deeper level of understanding of the law of impermanence at work in your own mind body. And that has transformative power. You're already on your way. You launched. So that's part of it. Now what that helps you do is let go of your attachment to forms. Now some people are good at it to begin with or better than others. Some are so attached to their minds that they're going to suffer tremendously. Whatever the mind churns up. It's true. They grabs and it's just immense torment. But as you start to see what the mind isn't permanent. It's not just that the people were 1 minute you were this the next minute you were that and you see what the nature of the mind. It's not a thing. It's a process full of contradictions and randomness and unpredictability and it's out of your control. Then it loses its power. And that takes you to a much deeper place that we were talking about which is here right now. Okay. Emptiness. If I attachment to emptiness let's say I remember I described that I used to live here. Yeah. Okay. And let's say which I think there's some truth to. I was attached to a form. It was a good place. It protected me. Just anyone knows even if it's a humble little place it's your own. And you can do what you want in there and be quiet. Now if I'm really holding on to that and then it's taken away from me then I suffer a lot. And then someone comes along and said hey you're attached to it. That's why you're suffering. Look what they're doing. They're tearing it down and they're making it into a meditation hall. And you come back and you look at it and then you're right. It was nothing. The attachment to emptiness then is like a kind of disrespect for the form. The apartment had its value. If you attach to the emptiness you're getting attached to the let me use an example that's more within all of our range. Flowers. Anyone who loves flowers probably everyone here or most of us we love flowers. And you put them in water and then they're beautiful and we love to look at them and they're scent and so forth. And then they start to wither and wilt and then they die. Right. Maybe the first few times you start sobbing. But typically now as adults we see it in some Buddhist monasteries. It's a practice to let it go to the point of withering. They don't immediately take it out and put another fresh patch in because they want you to see it as a teaching not overdo it when it starts to be like that. So you watch the flowers and you enjoyed them while they were there. Now here are other ways of doing it. If you got totally attached to flowers then you would suffer immensely every time they withered. That part is clear to you. Right? Okay. But supposing you say they're worthless. I'm never going to have a flower again. They just go and die on you because what do they do? They just come up and then they go blah blah and then they're gone. Okay. That would be in the direction of attachment to emptiness. It's fine to love the flower as you understand its nature. If you understand its nature you don't have expectations that have nothing to do with its nature. You want it to last forever. It can't. It's not a mistake. This is the way nature is. Or as one of my teachers used to say it's like looking at a waterfall and saying praying to God bowing everywhere. I want the water to flow up. It's going to keep flowing down. That's the nature of water. The nature of flowers is to emerge blossom Bloom and then to wilt you're new to this. Don't get involved with all this emptiness stuff yet. No. One of the things I was thinking of is things that I have. Like a village that I visited 25 years ago. 35 years ago. Fishing village in coast of Spain as a kid. And it was beautiful. It was very picturesque and everything. Ten years later I was going back as a chaperone and some other young people and it was gone. It was Hercs and Aviating some umbrellas on the beach. Everybody that sold out they were gone. And friends of mine were also there. Really hurt to hear about it but this is what happened. Economics not only nature but economics does this. My town is torn down where I grew up and I accept that stuff. But I can enjoy the memory of it without being attached. Or as you get old you get a lot of good memories and some bad ones. But I can keep that memory without feeling okay. What's your question? That village. Excuse me? I don't know. Do you feel coldness? Then you would feel cold. Someone wouldn't. I'm not legislating how you're supposed to feel at the end of this. But the village as you knew it that was the way it was empty of an enduring core. But one way or another it had to go through that just as the flower did. The whole universe as we know the sun is not going to I don't know 2 trillion astronomers tell us not astrology they probably think they're here for anyway. So we know that that's the way things are. But then when it comes to numero Uno me somehow we go blank. We don't understand. Now that's fine. You are comfortable with your village now. It evolved into something else which is not totally different but it's also not the same. So in the language of the Buddha it's just technical language. It was empty of an enduring core. It had no autonomous reality. It doesn't mean that it didn't exist or it was a hallucination. It existed as long as certain conditions held it together. The conditions changed. Just what happened now there are certain conditions brought this terrorist thing that came together more than we can figure out that brought this to bear. And now there's no World Trade Center. And do you see what I'm getting at? Emptiness sickness is when you get fixated on the nothingness of it all. And you disregard the fact that form is here to stay and that our life is in the midst of forms of change. And the problem the suffering isn't from the changing forms. The suffering is from our fixation. We hold on to things and then if they change we have a hard time accepting it. And that's where the pain comes in. One more please. You. Yeah.", 'human_start_time': '1:29:35'}, {'talkname': '20011121-Larry_Rosenberg-CIMC-self_knowing_a_quiet_passion_2-8728', 'question_num': 'Question 7', 'url': '/talks/8728/20011121-Larry_Rosenberg-CIMC-self_knowing_a_quiet_passion_2-8728.mp3', 'display_name': 'Self Knowing - A Quiet Passion (2)', 'date': '11/21/01 19:30', 'start_time': 5939050, 'content': "I've been hearing a lot of things about incoming and I try to think about it when things don't turn out to be the way I expect it to be. But sometimes when I try to be happy I also think of implements and I know it's not going to be there with me all the time. So I don't understand how you can be happy if you think about impermanence. But I'm not saying think about impermanence. See if I can tell you from the point of view of this practice. I learned my stuff in Thailand. So who am I to tell you anything? It's in your blood. You could tell me a thing or two. I'm sure there are two kinds of insights I mentioned. One is reflective. That's a skillful use of thought and the other is direct seeing. So you know that things are impermanent. And sometimes in a way we talk to ourselves sort of like oh of course this had a change and it helps ease things. Okay. But then it's not like what is being suggested here is we go around keep thinking of permanent and permanent. But you can learn that when happiness is there you can enjoy it and then when it's gone it's gone. Let me take a very simple example. Sunset let's say is a beautiful sunset. No one's saying you can't enjoy it. You're there and it's just beautiful. So much in nature is especially the mind is clear and you're appreciating the sunset and goes down. Your heart is all warm and it's beautiful. No suffering. Then the next day you come running back to get it again. And it isn't the way it was. Or you start comparing it in Acapulco was better than the first was joy. One way to talk about it was joy. The second was a quest for pleasure where we try to get it. Now if you can allow yourself to be happy when it's there knowing that of course it's not going to last forever. And while you're happy you're happy. It's just a fact. And then it's gone. And then what's next is what's next. Now there's a deeper place than happiness. Unhappiness happiness unhappy. And that's what Rumi's point. There's a place that isn't. The happiness you're talking about is subject to vicissitude. Change. Coming and going rising and falling praise and blame healthy and sick all those kind of things. If you can get comfortable with it be with it. Let it go be with it let it go. It takes you to someplace. You could call it true happiness. That's deeper than whether you have good fortune or bad fortune. Good fortune must alternate with bad fortune. Good health and bad health praise and blame wealth and poverty strength and weakness all of those. If you don't believe me check your life. Is there any of those qualities? You have them forever? I don't think so. But we're talking about something that never anything that arises passes away. What the Buddhist saying is something that never was born so it can't die. Okay so it's not that you shouldn't be happy. But when you're happy enjoy the happiness. And when it's gone just know the truth of that and be with what's next. That's the practice. Does that make sense? Okay one more and then really we should please.", 'human_start_time': '1:38:59'}, {'talkname': '20011121-Larry_Rosenberg-CIMC-self_knowing_a_quiet_passion_2-8728', 'question_num': 'Question 8', 'url': '/talks/8728/20011121-Larry_Rosenberg-CIMC-self_knowing_a_quiet_passion_2-8728.mp3', 'display_name': 'Self Knowing - A Quiet Passion (2)', 'date': '11/21/01 19:30', 'start_time': 6143930, 'content': "Well to pick up on the tribalism theme I've been finding this time to be very interesting around that. And I'm glad that when they called us about what Buddhists think that you refuse they were trying to impose a tribe there. And my immediate reaction to 911 was feeling like I'm being asked to be part of this tribe. America it's not my tribe. I want to find who are my people what is my country. And so I went to peace demonstrations immediately and people were talking about forgiveness and all of that. And I thought this is my tribe. And now I'm coming. As I'm stepping out of that I'm realizing that's not right either. There's plenty of people who I can identify with who are not so sure that we should behave peacefully or whatever. I mean I don't necessarily agree with them but they're not people I want to write off either. But you're into writing in and writing off. Go ahead. Yeah I know. I noticed that myself. But it's also very much if you go out and demonstrate for peace you will find that you are put or even talk to people about forgiveness. Suddenly that costs in a way. Well that's what other people do to you right? Okay. But I'm talking about inner stability. Let's play this back. I love America. I honestly do. I had a flag hanging from my window that probably disappoints you. Sorry. I love it. I served in the military for two years willingly. I was drafted but I didn't bear arms because I didn't believe in it. But I did believe in serving my country. I love this country. I am immensely grateful for what it's my heritage is one of my family. I grew up knowing what my parents went through to get here. I'm from immigrant background and then I've traveled a lot. I love this. That doesn't mean that I don't care about other countries. Just like a person who has self respect doesn't mean that they're not compassionate. They may be more compassionate with someone else because they feel stable. So I think the art is not even being in a tribe. When it becomes an identity tightly held over and about. We do it for security. You were looking for a new tribe so you'd feel secure and everyone's doing that. And then we create insecurity it backfires. So I'm a Jew I'm a Palestinian. And then why do you do that? Because I want to belong. These are my people. I go back I have my history. I know that one. Well okay then the Palestinians have their own. God said this dessert. No God said so. The problem isn't in being a Palestinian and loving your culture and the food and all that. It's just sort of like I'm 59 and a half. The problem is it becomes a fixation and it gets set. It's dualistic. It gets set up over and above whatever opposite you want to make peace. Nick warmonger. And that's what the mind until it gets free is doing. Yeah. I think we're kind of entering a period that feels very McCarthy and very dualistic where people I don't know that's just been my experience. You can make whatever analogies you want. I lived. Were you alive when the McCarthy thing was happening? I wasn't. I was but I'm just saying it just feels very different now to speak about forgiveness. This one is a challenge to all of us because I'm not for violent responses. But in this one the problem with the violence is that it's so conditioned in you all the societies when something goes wrong that's all we think of is we got to hit back. We don't think is there anything else we could do now in terms of this? If you're the head of a country any country and someone kills 5000 let's say now they say it's less. It doesn't make the pain less. Let's say of your citizens do you think what would Gandhi do? Would he go on a fast? Do you think the terrorists care if he fasts? This is a different kind of we don't know where the enemy is. It's not bound to pause and say I don't know. What I hope is that all the oxygen isn't taken up by war as the solution so that there's some oxygen left to try to understand what got us here like reexamine our foreign policy especially in the Middle East reexamine the impact we have on other people because of the tremendous wealth we have and et cetera et cetera not to blame America but to try to understand that this didn't come out of chicken liquor whatever. It didn't just drop from the sky. What is that? Chicken. Chicken a little. The Buddhist scheme is very low. It causes in effect causes an effect. So wisdom is to try to say well how did I contribute to these causes in your case? Same as an individual that now have gotten me into mashed in here where people hate me so much oh I'm just a total Saint and they hate me. Maybe some innocent people have been killed because they belong to a certain. But we're talking about inner work. If you want to be free you can be love America and not be a problem to the world. And unless your love of America is such that it makes everyone else you're into superior and inferior you also care more if an American dies than if an Afghani dies et cetera et cetera being in a tribe seems very human. We humans seem to love to be in a tribe and then we feel secure. The problem is the security makes us insecure because everyone else is doing it and then we fight with each other and it backfires. Are the Israelis better off? Are the Palestinians better off? I doubt it 50 years or however long it's been going on anyway. Blah blah blah. Have a good Thanksgiving. Let's pause for one moment. I don't know how you feel maybe some of your personal life or what's happened. Disappointment. I don't know. But the Buddhist way is a very humble teaching from Thailand from a forest teacher. Let's say you get a mango and there's a worm in it. You can throw the whole mango out or you can enjoy the rest of the mango and put it in other terms. It's a good idea during Thanksgiving whether you don't feel American or you do feel American. Is there anything to give thanks for? I think you will find is there anything right with your life? Is there anything right with America? You may have to do some forgiving? I don't know. So you don't have to throw the whole mango out. I'm sure that no matter how you are feeling about this you could find some things that are good about yourself about the world and you can enjoy the mangle wherever you are.

The talk that you gave me I'm not knowing how I fired perfectly but that's what I am trying to do day by day not on cushion not on meditation not just in the meditation. Got it. Me too. Now I have someone that I love very deeply and I don't know if this is the kind of a question. That truths just throw it out. And that's the person throw the question out. Yeah. Because when things happen I look to it myself as the cause of the suffering because of clinging or expectations or whatever. I have an individual that everything is always somebody else's fault. He's always looking. And you said this in part of your talk about the people who look externally to the other place to find the reason why they're suffering if they keep doing with different people or in different circumstances essentially like mankind has done the same way of solving the problems of looking at the problems. Now you can't really look to advise people of what to do. You should go to the CINC that will streak you. Well. But it's hard in the relationship that I'm talking about to sit idly by and not trying to make that person more conscious about the need to do what you talked about tonight. Yes. It's very common with all of us. In fact one of the things over the years I've spoken to many couples and it's very common for one person to be a meditator and the other one isn't. My wife is not a meditator. I'm vegetarian. She's not. There's a whole long list of things. She's born in Russia. I was born here. She doesn't know the most obvious. So what the heck are we doing together? Can a meditator and a nonmeditator live happily together? What I found is the key thing is respect. Now I'm going to get to what you're asking that is you have to respect this other person's right to not be as wise as you by coming to CIMC et cetera. I am being a little bit sarcastic but you understand. And of course for a friendship to happen or a marriage or a partnership they have to respect your right to do this kind of work. Then I've seen it work. When it becomes a political football it doesn't work out too well. What to do? Because certainly I'm not exempt. Sometimes I see ways in which people I love my sister she doesn't have these resources and she has no interest at all in developing them. Every time we visit with each other should we go through the same exchange? Larry what is this meditation? And my wife has told me don't go through it. So about ten or I'll go through a whole long thing a mini Dharma talk and she'll look very instant and it'll go. And then the next time it's the very same thing she's not interested. But here's the piece that might be of some help. It has helped me and certainly some other people. You have a reaction to these people who are let's say it's one person in particular. Okay. You have a reaction and that reaction. You can't help that reaction. You feel badly for them. You feel impatient you feel Frank whatever you feel. But in a given moment instead of trying to make the ideal Buddhist action or compassionate action or whatever is so good focus in on your reaction that it's bothering you that it's frustrating that you're annoyed with the person that you feel sorry. Whatever is you're feeling from moment to moment it's not thinking about it. They come in your presence and you can see what's happening and you have a reaction. Now the reaction is mechanical. It comes out of your conditioning. Okay? So if you're aware of the reaction and a lot of practice in daily life is just that it's becoming aware of our reactivity which is automatic. It comes out of our upbringing our school system our wounds our joys et cetera if you're aware of it that doesn't mean trying to eliminate it but you're aware of it. Little by little it loses its power and then that creates a space in that space. I don't know what you should say or do maybe nothing but I have greater faith in the clear mind that replaces the reactivity because out of that comes what you could call a response. A response is not mechanical. And sometimes for example here's one thing I had to learn with my wife. She would come home. She works in a hospital with a lot of very elderly sick Russians who are in pain and complaining and et cetera. And then she comes home. And then at times she'll start and then I have a beautiful Dharma talk to give her. And that's not what she wants. She just wants me to listen. And it took me I don't know two or three years. I finally learned. I said oh duh you're not interested in my immense storehouse of wisdom. What you would like is to just be a good person who cares to listen to her. And I talked it to her and she says yes that's exactly what. So that was hard for me to learn how to do that because I'm in the fixing things business. But I've learned that now what might come out of the new space that you create by taking care of the reaction it gets weaker and weaker as you do. That is maybe it's silence. Maybe you say the same thing that you've been saying for a few years but the energy is different and the person is much more able to listen. Or maybe you ask a fresh question to them that never occurred to you before. I don't know. But I trust that space. That's the beginner's mind that some of you have read about the don't know mind. It's the freshness rather than coming out of all of our formulas and recipes for what would be good for that. Do you see what I'm getting at? The reason that I asked for this kind of insight into how to help this person that's my desire to try to help is that I haven't said anything. I haven't reacted. I created that exact space and I'm kind of drawn back from it. I do understand how I feel but you're having the reaction inwardly anyway. Otherwise it sounds like it sounds like a lot of frustration there. I see that there have been so many decisions that have been made that have been very hurtful the outcomes that he wanted. I got it. I understand. But I'm sorry to interrupt. There are other people involved in the life that are going to get caught on a crossfire like a Spaghetti Weston. Okay but here's what I'm saying. The fact that you restrain yourself that's one extreme. The other extreme is a person just reacts verbally all the time or physically. The other is you restrain yourself but the reactivity is still going on and it's building up in you and you want something else whether you express it verbally or physically or not. Practice with the reactivity that opens the mind up. I don't know what's next but you're in a better position. Here's what I found. There's a better chance of what comes out of your mind maybe even depicting your view of what's going on with other people. That is kinder and wiser but no guarantees.

Good. Please Larry my question. Yes. For me wise to come to a place where I could have a refuge and I could be safe from all of the conflicts that arise from the insane world. I understand personal conflict. And so I've been coming and as I've been coming and I'm sitting like they say sitting like looking at a mirror I see that I'm really not doing the walk. I'm not walking into the focus attribute. I'm escaping it. I feel like I'm doing something good because I'm in Cambridge and I'm sitting here and I'm working on meditating. You are doing something good. It's just somewhat limited. That's all right. What's happening is I go. Let's say I go on Friday to work on forming an identity because I'm one of those people that really have a hard time with identity. Good. I hope you get one on Friday. Look I don't know what you pay your therapist but you could save yourself a lot of money. Don't go to get this identity. Just be a nobody. I know I'm being a wise guy here. Stop. Go ahead. Keep going. Keep going. To be dealing with some major health concern. Yes. And I was told today by someone I consider a very wise person that I have scheduled surgery. But the advice this person gave me was don't have the surgery. Start living your life and your body will take care of the rest. Which sounds simplistic. And he really said I'm not telling you to never have the surgery. I'm just telling you to immerse yourself in life and in the problems of living a little bit more and see what happens. And so I'm hearing him say that and I'm hearing you say walk to walk. Full catastrophe living. Don't make it so black and white. I'm not a medical expert. You may need to have the surgery. Despite what this other person said I honestly don't know. And I'm not sure this other person knows. They may be correct sometimes. But look here's all let's start with the fact that you enjoy coming to the safety of let's say a CIMC in places like it. It's nice to have an Oasis somewhere in this world which sometimes feels awfully barren a nice place. I don't mean to discredit that and everyone personally I have learned I wasn't always so tolerant. I've learned to respect everyone's path as quite unique and also what you want from the practice and one person may just want that some of that will spill over into daily life anyway. It has to you have more energy you're a little bit more optimistic you see a little bit more clearly. But the full wisdom practice takes advantage of that. Keep doing it. By all means if you like do more of it. But if you attach to it then you create a separation between that and then the rest of life. And if that works for you I'd be quite surprised. I know. So that it's not one versus the other. For example CIMC was started I'm just giving you my mouth because I started guilty of starting this place because having done lots of long silent retreats in Asia and here I mean months on end and seeing that people including myself we would become very intoxicated with the tremendous peace and joy of leaving all of this stuff behind and just going off to some beautiful mountain in Korea or Japan or wherever or here and a Barry and just with nice people and silence and no one can become a pain in the what you're going to call for each other. And that was great. And a lot got accomplished. And I also noticed that when we come off that people would then life would be devoted to earning enough money to go back for the next long retreat and wearing those retreats like combat ribbons. Sort of a Desert Storm Iraq three month retreat of 1983 five months in Korea et cetera. Wearing them down here and most of life is passing them by. It's possible to be. It's a kind of nonhospitalizable schizophrenia. It doesn't work. In short unless you are look there are people who are born contemplatives. I've spent time with a few a hermit in Korea. They live out their whole life in a cave. They're not coming back. They are incredibly happy there. Okay. Now I did my best to draw out this person they're practicing in the cave. How many people here want to live out the rest of their life in the cave? I don't think so. Okay now a second Herman I spent time with. It's good that he was in his cave. It was a hut not so way up in the mountains because he was unbearably neurotic and to inflict him on people. And also they couldn't live with him. So he knew enough to stay out of trouble by being with the first guy was really at peace. You have to find your own way. But the fact is most of your life is going to be lived with people isn't it? Right. Okay. This is the crucial. I'm sorry I didn't have time to get to this. Many spiritual paths including this in my opinion are very colored by the monastic approach which has dominated Buddhism for thousands of years. Okay. In that approach the main people not exclusively they've always been lay people who've lived full lives with families and all the rest and have also gotten enlightened. But predominantly there's been monks mainly monks and some nuns who have lived a very specialized life. And when that and they've gotten into that because maybe all of us come to this practice because of relationship. We're wounded. Relationship is a battlefield whether it's nations with each other or religions with each other or us with each other partners with each other et cetera. We don't seem to know how to do that. That's what I was trying to say. So let's get out of here. Let's go off to a mountain to a cave or get lost in activities. But we don't seem to understand the importance of learning. For example one of my wonderful teacher named I'd rather not use his name. And he would talk about lay life this way say like well there's all this suffering I hear about marriage. And in spite of that all these lay people they just jump up and volunteer for the job. And then some of the younger ones because I lived with monastics celibate and so forth. I've never been a Monk but I have spent extended periods of time living in that community and living like them temporarily. And it's very functional for them to see relationship as it's hopeless. Everything is hopeless. The planet is hopeless. Sex is ridiculous because that justifies the choice they've made. It makes it easier for them to remain celibate. I ain't missing anything. Okay so it's functional for them. They've made a choice. And for some of them it works out beautifully. Not for all. People have romantic views about monks or nuns. Some use that they're born for it in my opinion. Okay so here we are. If we are lay people and we're not just here to support to give food medicine clothes and shelter to the people who are really doing it we want to do it ourselves. We want to suffer less. We don't want to just chant and bow to famous monks and then go home feeling that we're blessed and taken care of. I haven't seen that work too much. Although you may believe in it. I don't. Okay so we can't run away from relationship. We have no choice because our life is made up of relationship. So we need a new attitude a totally different attitude. And it exists in Dharma. Sort of a bad situation is a good situation or another way of putting it is that by which we humans fail is also that by which we can succeed. But it's a radical change in attitude. You have to start seeing that the very difficulty of let's say work or relationship or whatever it is for you. You have to really take it on and you're going to make mistakes and you're going to fail over and over again. But you have to understand I've been at it for a while. I hope I'm to some degree walking my talk. Am I completely walking my talk? Probably not. I don't know if anyone can. It's hard but is a tremendously rich relationship as a teacher to yourself if you're willing to learn and not just stuck in being right all the time and learning how to apologize and how to more and more because my problem there's only one problem that I have and that problem is Larry. It would be a much better world without Larry. Much better certainly for me and for anyone in my world. So I'm working on. But you can't kill it if I try to kill Larry. That's just the ego saying all right you want to kill Larry? Great. I'll do whatever you want as long as I run the joint. That's the ego. It's brilliant. So it's more getting to understand it and sort of taking some of the power out of it. And even some of the thrusts in life need a kind of centered ego. It's fine. We don't have to crucify ourselves the wrong choice. But anyway. So yes but maybe reenter slowly pick on something like some difficulty you have. But some people just don't do that. And I can just tell you what I think. I think we have no choice since most of our life is relationship. But if you decide you just want to give your best to sitting at home and sitting here and going to retreat centers and then the heck with this. It's your life. It's fine with me. So that everyone relates to it to the degree to which they can. I'm with the Greeks. I think his Socrates I'm pretty sure he said the main question we face is how is one to live? Each of us faced that question how are we to live? And we've been brought up this is how you should live. And then mindlessly we just do it. Typically if you really start to go into this you've broken from that. You realize you start to look at something that has been taken for granted. You haven't examined it because you don't realize how much of it has just been handed to you from your parents the school system the culture and so forth. And maybe it's fine and you keep doing it but in a different way. And maybe it isn't how you want to live at all but the question never goes away. How is one to live? And this is designed to help us do that but not in an abstract way. But you start by how do we actually live? How do you actually live? How do I actually live? And you start there and you end there. The first step is the last step because it keeps being like that. It's not like you become perfect. Maybe some people become perfect. I haven't met them yet. Some are called great Masters great gurus. I didn't see it but I'm from Brooklyn and we're warped Missouri too. I think I'm from Missouri. Never sat anyone here from Missouri. I don't want anyone to sue me. Wrong speech and all that. It's a compliment actually. I'm bragging. Okay but you see what I'm getting at. It's up to you. But I think don't throw away the good part now. Then you're still left with Should I undergo surgery or not? Okay look I don't know. No but I'm exploring how you might help yourself answer it. First of all your friend gave you this advice and that must bring up something in you. Maybe it's a relief. Then oh great I don't have to do surgery. I just have to go out and do that. And then maybe when you go out and do that you see that wow that's really hard to do. And then you say Maybe I should do surgery. You could spend months going back and forth. Okay we all have the same mind. So what you may find out is that also if you have fear of doing the surgery face that fear because then you may be all that eager to hear all kinds of advice that enable you to not do the surgery when you really should. I have no idea that's why I meant by I trust a clear mind. Whatever comes out of that much more than any friend even well meaning it's your decision it's your life. And if you see your reactivity to the surgery to his or her suggestion et cetera there's a clearer space that emerges. That's what our practice is about. And I trust what can come out of that the decision. But life is big. Well that's why I asked the question because I don't want to enter into the walk with an expectation. I want to do it for its own sake. I don't want to say if I start taking on this problem or that problem then maybe I'm going to get better. I don't want to do that. I just want to do just like sitting. I want to sit because I want to sit not because I want to be calmer. Okay. You're saying something very big and some of you I know are tired. It's been a long day. No it's not you. It's that at a certain point we have to okay I'm sorry. Bring me back. It's the early stages of senility. What were you just saying? Just bring me back to that. Okay. I got it. I remembered now. I remembered now. Life is for living. Isn't that the most obvious thing? Why are we alive? It's to live. But so often what we do is we live in order to I'll do this in order to get a promotion. I'll do that to get this. I'll do this. In the meantime the actual experience of living of being alive is bypassed. That's why there's all this emphasis on be here now be into power now. What's so great about now? Well it's all we have. There's nothing else. And now it has infinite depth. So the practice is really more and more preferring to live in the now which is a fact then all kinds of stuff about an imaginary future or some reconstructed past. And that means just living for Living's sake and the learning that comes out of that does liberate you so you don't have to have this big program. I'm here. Is this freeing me? Is that freeing me? Because every moment when you're fully aware awake it's a moment of being free in moments when we're grasping holding on pushing away fighting and conflict struggling we're enslaved one last anything if there is please.", 'human_start_time': '0:59:48'}, {'talkname': '20070509-Larry_Rosenberg-CIMC-is_it_possible_to_be_sane_in_an_insane_world-35553', 'question_num': 'Question 3', 'url': '/talks/35553/20070509-Larry_Rosenberg-CIMC-is_it_possible_to_be_sane_in_an_insane_world-35553.mp3', 'display_name': 'Is it Possible to be Sane in an Insane World?', 'date': '5/9/07 19:00', 'start_time': 4616810, 'content': "This is what it's all about.

Okay. Is that considered a form of meditation? Yes but I would include driving on the interstate. I would say especially driving on the interstate. Well I have to know what he meant because. Oh sure. Then I wholeheartedly agree. I would get into the car is what I would get into yes. No. Well put. There's a difference between in a way what we were doing. The first part where you're mindful of the breath where the main thing you're being asked to do is to be with the object. And then there's something else which is in addition to being mindful of the object or the situation are you discerning about it? Are you seeing what's going on or is wisdom has to we more and more have to be informed by wisdom. Our life has to wisdom has to become our best friend. The Chitta has to start listening to what wisdom is and acting on behalf of wisdom. Let me be a little bit more clear. Let's say there's so many different forms. Let's say there's chanting ceremonies listening to a tape let's say music listening to a tape about what being a mountain. Okay. Some of that. What effect does that have on you when you listen to it? Very calm right? Exactly. Okay. Now if you just do that then it's just relaxation which is necessary especially if you're very tense which many of us are. But inside meditation Vipasana is more than calm and relaxation. In fact if you've been doing this you know that sometimes it creates stress. It's not just stress reduction because when you start looking at certain things you say oh my God I thought I'm a nonviolent disciple of Gandhi. I'm Otto Hitler. Why didn't my friends tell me this? And there's anguish. So it's not just about relaxing but we spent a lot of time on that aspect and many things can help you listening to nice that music certain phrases chanting can help concentrate and calm the mind. Wisdom is kind of drawing the significance out of what's happening to you drawing it out of that. But the calmness helps you do that. In other words once the mind gets calmer it becomes more clear so it can see. It's like having a prescription. Let's say you have glasses and finally you have the right prescription. So calming is nice and it's part of the journey. But from the point of view of this practice it's not the whole thing. And so if it helps you some days you come home and let's say you feel very upset. And if that is calming. That's very good. But if you don't look at why you're upset ever then it won't go away. It's just going to be an alternation between calming and upset. Calming and upset. We already know how to do that. You get very upset. You're in the refrigerator. That calms you down takes your mind off the problem. Very upset. Let's go to a movie. Very upset. Call a friend. Very upset. Dive into a book. So this is not new. We've offered something else the breath which can be misused too. The breath can calm you down I hope you know. And if you get fixated on that then you will deprive yourself of a certain other kind of riches which comes from learning. And that's what we call wisdom. Does that make sense? Yes. It's a form if I could put it in another language it's a form of self reeducation where finally you are the teacher and the student life is really the teacher. Life is constantly tireless never stops teaching. Things are happening. There's a lesson in everything that's happening if nothing else. In this practice impermanence is a very important teaching. We didn't have enough time to give it as much time as it deserves because it opens up into so much. We can just hint at it. Well life is constantly teaching and everything. Life isn't permanent. Life is impermanent but there aren't enough students. The curriculum is unfolding. The course is going on but no one seems to want to go to class. So here we have to like hey life isn't permanent. You better learn that because it affects everything you're doing. And if you learn it you can really live a lot better. Yeah it's learning. But don't throw away the calmness part. That's good too right? Yes. Again there's no one answer. There are a number of things that can be useful. And over time you learn how to take care of yourself best but for example just staying within the confines of what we know here. If I sat down and I felt you know what I in fact do almost all the time before I turn to the breath I mentioned it here and in some of the discussion groups. And I certainly would do that if I felt let's say very agitated or the minds all over the place instead of going to the breath step number one is I would acknowledge what my starting point is. Oh look at that. I don't want to meditate. I hate being here. I feel so restless. I'm ready to punch a hole in the wall. And they want me to sit here and just quietly smile and be with my breath. I don't want to do that. And sometimes what happens is you see what your starting point is resistance restlessness and so forth. Somehow the mind appreciates that just that you know what's going on and it subsides a wee bit. And then you can turn to the breath. Sometimes especially as you go on in this practice maybe you have to look at the problem directly right off with a limited amount of concentration you have because there's no way you can be with the breath you try. Or you can use other tools which we didn't emphasize but which were brought up by some of you counting the breath for example if the mind's thinking a lot it's obsessed. It's got lots of thoughts. Well and give it something to nibble on. Give it a thought a skillful thought like counting one person mentioned 12345 or if you get better out of the ten on the out breath or on both it could be in one out 12233 or a simple in out in out. And there are many other phrases in the Taifar's tradition they would teach us. Buddha Buddh means the one who knows. It's another name for the Buddha. So on the in breatho in addition to reminding you that you are the Buddha it can be helpful. And sure things like yoga and other taking a warm bath or just taking a nice walk outside.", 'human_start_time': '0:50:15'}, {'talkname': '19940227-Larry_Rosenberg-UNK-ordinary_dharma-1495', 'question_num': 'Question 2', 'url': '/talks/1495/19940227-Larry_Rosenberg-UNK-ordinary_dharma-1495.mp3', 'display_name': 'Ordinary Dharma', 'date': '2/27/94 0:00', 'start_time': 3546890, 'content': "I've been finding the past of a life as I'm feeling more peace from starting this practice. I'm really dramatically aware of the polls of certain relatives and certain community friends who I would call difficult. I would call needy I would call sucking. They're always trying to suck the energy away. And I'm experimenting with having boundaries and saying no and all this. And oftentimes I just feel a little bit that he doesn't. I'm not really giving very much in this sense. And I'm just curious about. Well that's a big one. Yes. I wouldn't be so arrogant as to say that I can give you a little open little answer and you're all set now because we all have a lot of that in different forms in life. But a few things come to mind. It's good that your scientists experience more calm. Is that what you said? Inner peace? What was the word you used? Peacefulness. Yeah. Okay. Understand that if you keep practicing that gets deeper. That is a form of nourishment. Finally when you can drop into a still mind when the mind is really still and let's say even if you're there for a minute or 30 seconds sometimes you can really feel when you come out of it. It's like having a nice rest. I'm not exaggerating. When the mind gets very still that means nothing's happening. There's no thinking or very little. Other thoughts are like snowflakes with no potency. You just come through and you learn how to often when we get into that stillness we fight it because we're afraid of it or we're not used to it. You learn how to really allow yourself to just bathe in it to bathe in that stillness and you begin to see that the stillness is not nothing. Sometimes people say well nothing's happening. The truth is it's charged with aliveness of stillness. And if you can allow yourself to take that on then you have more energy to bring to those people who are wanting stuff from you in the way in which only you know. So some of that will come just naturally as your practice develops. You'll have more energy of that kind. But there are other things that can help as well. Some of what is tiring you is that you have expectations of it being other than the way it is. You want them to not want things from you. Perhaps you want them to become meditators and great bodhisattvas and start doing yoga and organic food and maybe they don't want to do that. Do you see what I'm getting at? So look at your site. Some of the problem is it's complex. Sometimes with friends you outgo friends. And in my own life there have been some very painful times where you love a person. You went all through in my own case there was a group of us. We all went to University of Chicago together. We were like a family. And then I was the only one who turned in this direction and little by little they started being annoyed with me and Asian bullshit they would call it and still doing that Asian crap they didn't know what it was.", 'human_start_time': '0:59:06'}, {'talkname': '19890304-Larry_Rosenberg-UNK-blending_practice_with_life-1561', 'question_num': 'Question 1', 'url': '/talks/1561/19890304-Larry_Rosenberg-UNK-blending_practice_with_life-1561.mp3', 'display_name': 'Blending Practice With Life', 'date': '3/4/89 0:00', 'start_time': 2415190, 'content': "If you're in a situation that gets out of hand before your awareness as you say gets quicker and quicker. Let's say you're in the middle of a relationship and it gets out of hand. You can't just excuse me I need to breathe for a while. Who said? Who said you can't if you're really. Caught up in the effort? Yeah. Okay. This is hard to answer because if both people are on the path they can help each other. For example the one who's less out of control can say what's happening right now. Where are we? This is all new AGS isn't it? What I mean is we can do that. But let's say now from the point of view of an individual let's say you pick up on you've lost it you're out of control. And that happens a lot in relationship. But at a certain point perhaps you come in contact with it. It's not that you have to follow your breathing. It's that just to remember that you're out of control. You just notice it has a breaking quality to it. It slows it down and then as you begin to investigate you may even do something. Let's say one teacher suggested it's a very good practice. Some of you have heard of her Vimela Takar who's come to our center off and on. What she said is supposing it's all over and you have blown it. She said it's a very good practice to go back to the person and apologize. Just say you know I just realized that was all wrong. I mean I was just defending myself and it may be an hour later or maybe two days later you go and you apologize. It's hard for us to do but it has a very wonderful effect. But now in the middle of it which is what you're more concerned about. Well you're obviously somewhere along where you. Are going to catch it. Okay. Well some of what it's like is you'll have to think of it this way. As the practice develops what people tend to notice is that you pick up on the onset of let's say it's aggression or a fight about to have you start to feel like the irritability like back there. You just feel like you feel some movement of the neck or you catch it before it's full blown. That is one thing that happens with practice. You begin to see that the other is and this to me is the main one. As the mind gets more calm it gets harder and harder to bear a false note. Whereas if you're wanting to be right in the process of bullying someone and then there's a bit of quiet. And if you're doing this practice you know it's just hard to escape. The other person doesn't even have to bring it up. You just realize what you said was off. What you're doing is you see why you're doing it and you pick up from where you are. I mean you start right there. It's of course very helpful. If both people are committed to a genuine dialogue. What do you do in a situation where it's not even another person? Let's say it's just the CBS News. Okay that's a good one. Okay let me give you an example. This happened just a couple of days ago in the staff dining room. Someone was reading All Greenpeace and Toxic Times. And just seeing this world is in bad shape. Is there anyone who doesn't agree with that person? We have a little breakfast club in there. We're sitting eating breakfast. And the person had read all these and came in very on the depressed side and just saying I've been reading these periodicals late last night and I woke up just feeling and this went on for a few months. I didn't say anything but in a few moments and a few more moments and then it was about Greenpeace and about helping here. And then what you saw was that the person was very down about the situation in the world. It's hard not to play teacher wherever you go like trying not to. But here of course it's more legitimate. But anyway we talked and the person was really troubled by periodically feeling awful about the way the world was going. Well the world has always been going awful. It's not new the world Samsara. Now the stakes are higher. Maybe it's not bow and arrows. Now it's nuclear weapons but also worlds come to an end. Now I'm not talking about this in terms of that. We should be complacent and just let everything happen. Not at all. But there is also another truth. Okay let's say it's something like that. Now you're outraged about something now in that moment are you helping the problem of pollution? Let's say especially if this is a recurring thing now every now and then we all do it. But if the person is in the habit of feeling very bad about the way the world is then I feel this practice can be tremendously helpful. First of all what have they accomplished? Nothing. That is they're not joining Greenpeace. They're not going out and helping in some way so that there's a dissatisfaction they're going to do something about it. If it doesn't work at least they've done something about it. What they're doing is just commenting on how bad it is and getting depressed. So they've added one more casualty to the world. Now whatever the number of casualties it's 10 billion plus one and nothing's improved. There isn't any less toxin in the world. And now there's one more toxic person in the world. I don't see the point. So that it seems to me what the option the person has is seeing through it. Again it's not to say how great everything is but what is to be added by our personal depression in that way because it's a kind of helplessness. It is really going to the root of our sense of helplessness and either doing something about it or releasing ourselves from something that is futile because it's not really amounting to anything. This is just the way I feel about it. Now in the process you are doing something about that because one of the main ways in which we all bring toxins into the world is by just Loading our moods on top of each other. Now if this person could actually be happy the Dalai Lama is happy. Anyone who's met him knows he's a happy man in the midst of a catastrophe. And it doesn't mean he doesn't do anything about it because he's extremely dedicated to the political situation of the Tibetans. It doesn't mean that you have to be depressed to work hard. For example the Buddha and Jesus led revolutions that are still going on now. And the work didn't come just out of anger. It came out of love. So that if you're spending a lot of time hating what's going on and feeling terrible about it I think the practice can be very very helpful. Again it's not to be complacent. We all do need to do something for this world. And one thing to do is of course as one Vietnamese Buddhist Monk put it is to be peace. If you want a peaceful world start with yourself again. So that's eliminating certain sentimentalities that are really not so helpful where we somehow feel so sad about what's going on. Again we can't help but feel that because there's enough reason to. But if it's something that's going on a lot I think it really should be investigated and see what that really is. Sometimes we use these outer things as an occasion for us to be depressed about something else that's bothering us. Yes.

In investigating the restlessness I thought my. Heart is being. But I was finding it kind of. I just think you have some. What do you do when you hit kind of that sucky place? The thing is starting to take you over and you're trying to investigate and then you go back to the breath but it's kind of got you anyway. And then I feel like I just. Sort of lose it. Whatever somebody I've got or whatever it is. Yeah. Be simpler. I know it's like a burden that you've put on yourself to get the perfect Samadi to get back to the breath to not be restless. The best help is a different attitude with much more space around the whole event. Let's say a mood comes upon you and it's restlessness and then you investigate it. Now what does that mean to you? Investigate. This is precisely my question. I experience that as difficult while I'm experiencing the difficulty of the investigation. One rule of thumb that go back to the breath. Oh yes. Or use the breath as a support while investigating that for some people is extremely helpful. Have any of you tried that and found it helpful? A lot of practice is either with the breath or you're with restlessness. This is different. This is that the primary object is the restlessness because it's really obvious that that's what you should be with. It's taking over. Okay. So while you're with those sensations which we're calling restless in the background it kind of recedes in the background somewhat. You feel the in breath and the outbreath. And there's something in the soothing quality of being with the breath while you're investigating a non soothing object or an unpleasant object or a frightening object by staying in touch with the in breath and the outbreath. So that if I had to put it into words and this is paraphrasing the Anapanasati Sutta the Buddha being fully aware of restlessness the Yogi breathes in. Being fully aware of restlessness. The Yogi breathes out. It's simultaneous. They're happening together. And so sometimes that can be a big help. But if not just go back to your Samati practice. That would make the most sense. Yeah I was catching them like saying defending arguing. I found myself using those that they didn't feel judgmental. Is that okay? Well it depends what you set for yourself. You see there's a specific practice one very prominent school of the pastna Mahasi Cyadar style where you intentionally make metal notes for everything that's happening. But I don't feel that's what you're saying. It sounds like you're just thinking while it's all happening. Here's what I need to know. Are you using that technique of making mental notes? What's happening? If you know you have to know what you're every time you sit it's very helpful to know what you're attempting to do. What have you set for yourself? If that's not clear you're going to waffle all over the place. Because here's the difference. On one hand it's a technique you are intentionally as something comes up you apply a mental note to it. That's a very useful technique that's used. But if not if the mind just thinks it that's all right it's not criminal but that's part of the field of what we're observing. It's not something we're intentionally using to help us stay mindful. It's part of the field of what we have to be mindful of. Do you see what I'm getting at? So if you find that this is helpful you might want to explore using this technique because it's a perfectly good one if you're drawn to it. Well that's what the technique is. When you do it then you have to be really sensitive if there isn't subtle judgment hiding inside like defending judging so that it sounds like it's a nice neutral technique. But really all it is is self condemnation in disguise.", 'human_start_time': '0:49:02'}, {'talkname': '19890304-Larry_Rosenberg-UNK-blending_practice_with_life-1561', 'question_num': 'Question 4', 'url': '/talks/1561/19890304-Larry_Rosenberg-UNK-blending_practice_with_life-1561.mp3', 'display_name': 'Blending Practice With Life', 'date': '3/4/89 0:00', 'start_time': 3274870, 'content': "Like to check that I was a little nervous about the words that they could be judgmental and it could be yeah. Okay. The practice really is artful. There's a lot of free play for your own individual nature for your own creativity. It's not a cookbook recipe. This is what you do. 1234 ABC. It really isn't. As you go on you'll see that now at the beginning we do have to more or less standardize. And it's more like learning a musical instrument or dance where you do standard things over and over and over again until you then go freely. You dance freely or play freely. So it's something like that. But a lot of the time for example it's not so much having Am I selfing right now? Am I selfing? See that could become tedious. Then again you might set for yourself a particular period of time where you're very sensitive to that happening. But most of the time it's not so much that you're thinking about Am I selfing or not? Because if there's a flow if the flow of mindfulness is keeping up with the flow of events then you're not selfing. Because if you recall the whole danger is when we're not aware the eye and mind constantly is born. It's born a lot. I don't mean all the time during a typical day. It's dangerous when there's no awareness accompanying it. If it just comes up then we know it. We just hear the mind claiming something yes I did that for him and I'm one fine. And in the hearing of it if there's awareness accompanying this we're not trying to edit out. We can. It would be exhausting. The things that are coming out of this heart are just amazing what comes out of it. But what we can do is learn to meet what surfaces and we never know what's going to turn up with full awareness and more and more as we get better at doing that than what the ancients call taking the poison out of the snake. Whereas it's sort of something that sounds like it could be trouble sort of a self centered kind of thought. But because we're aware there's no venom in the snake goes and it goes like that but nothing happens. So it's not dangerous. And I would say a lot of the time it's much simpler. It's not so much thinking. It's more like a parade. Have you ever seen let's say the newsreels in the Soviet Union when the nation showing its strength it would be like the tanks go by. Let's say the heads of state are up high and the tanks go by and they salute. And then the soldiers with those steps they go by and there's a salute.", 'human_start_time': '0:54:34'}, {'talkname': '19890304-Larry_Rosenberg-UNK-blending_practice_with_life-1561', 'question_num': 'Question 5', 'url': '/talks/1561/19890304-Larry_Rosenberg-UNK-blending_practice_with_life-1561.mp3', 'display_name': 'Blending Practice With Life', 'date': '3/4/89 0:00', 'start_time': 3439694, 'content': "And then the Navy marches by and the salute. Then the army marches by and salute. And then it's a parade. Everything comes up high. There they go. It's not that different in the mind as we see the mind representing itself as being this and that. Right. That goes. And then the next one. The next one and it's a flow. The letting go at that point is just happening so easily. We're not getting stuck anywhere. It's what someone called keep a non abiding mind. The Chinese endmaster said keep a non abiding mind. And that's of course the fruit of the practice of very high accomplishment is to keep in mind that can land on something but doesn't get stuck. It can just be with what's there while it's there. When it's gone fine. And then it can be with whatever is next. And the letting go is more graceful. It's not sort of so bumpy of having to analyze and think and ponder. And then now and then though we get an insight and maybe we pull back for a moment. I guess that's what selling is. Look at that. I didn't realize. And that could be helpful. And then we go back to a much more just open and easy just more natural. Just let things happen. Let the mind just as we've been learning how to allow the breath to be natural to just empty itself. If the breath wants to be long let it be. If it wants to be shallow let it be. Can we be in touch with the breath as it follows its nature? Can we be in touch with our mind as it follows its nature? Now what you'll find is your ability to do this improves and you're seeing impermanence. Of course that's what I'm talking about. You're seeing everything arise and pass away. Arise and pass away. You'll see that it's an immense healing to the mind to the heart to the being whatever you want to call it. Because it's as if in allowing everything to go through the mind purifies itself it heals itself. And every time we grab onto something or we go like that then we have trouble. We're abiding somewhere. We made a home. This is where I am. We drop routes. Trouble because you can't drop roots anywhere in a world that's constantly changing. To grasp onto anything is an invitation to suffer. It makes no sense in anticipation. Maybe some of you are thinking well okay this nonattachment stuff sounds good but what about relationship? Is anyone thinking that? No. You are thinking that. Yeah. So you fall in love with someone you marry someone you live with someone. Aren't we attached? Aren't we attached to children? So they say this is a totally unrealistic teaching. What are these people saying? How can you love someone and be non attached to sound so cold? That gets said to me a lot. Okay our starting point or let's say a healthy way of bringing the practice into a relationship in terms of this issue is to not get too big for our Britches to not get ahead of ourselves. Because the truth is that mainly when we get involved there's a lot of attachment. We were lonely we meet someone. Oh thank God. Finally. And there's a lot of attachment. We all know all the variations the pulling away after the first few weeks. But if we have an ideal of perfection what would it be like if the Buddha got married? It's not going to work out too well. But what can be done and is being done by actual people like ourselves is that when you're in a relationship and granted that a fair amount of the energy has to do with insecurity and attachment because we're not perfect yet. And of course when we are we may not want to be in a relationship but I shouldn't say that because that's not good for business. You mean I'm going to become a nun or a Monk out of this? I don't want to become a nun or a Monk. No I'm not saying you will unless you really want to. If you really do then it won't be a problem. But that might be ten years from now or 20 years from 20 lifetimes from now. But what's realistic is let's say for people like ourselves we enter into a relationship. We start where we are and where we are is there's attachment in it and possessiveness and we work with that now. It's best if both people are willing to work with each other. But even if it's only one person is on the path there's no question that you can loosen that attachment up a bit. So it's not strangling you. It's just like a loose noose just like hanging like that. And there's no question that you can become much less possessive instead of like where are you going? When are you coming back? How long are you going to be waiting? Instead of doing that after a while we start to see like every time I do that it feels terrible to me and then the other person hates it. I'll be right back. I can't wait to get out of here. So again it's your question. The letting go comes out of not kind of sprouting wings and just flying out of our attachment. But it comes from really getting to know what attachment is really taking the time and the trouble and it takes courage and patience. It's not easy. It's to really understand oh this is what attachments like. And an image came to me some years ago. I still find it helpful. You know a fly on fly paper it's like stuck. Now let's say one thing is you try to free yourself from the attachment and you tear your wings. It doesn't work. The other thing is this is the approach of apasana. The approach of apasana is oh look at that. I can't move this arm and the head turns about a 10th of an inch and the back doesn't move at all does it? And you feel that you go into what is attachment anyway not as some ideology but and it's suffering. We see that when we're holding on like that or going like that it is not a good way to live. So that out of that may grow a genuine letting go. It comes out of intelligence not out of an ideology. The Buddha said you shouldn't be attached. Okay I won't be attached. And you rip your wings. It's not that it's out of understanding. The Buddha also talks so often over and over and over again about the importance of understanding of wisdom not to do things blindly not to do things because just some teacher told you to do. Or even the Buddha said not because I told you to do it. Investigate learn understand the laws of nature. We're part of nature. And then out of that comes the strength. Understanding has tremendous momentum and power. Yes it could be sure. You're experiencing boredom at work. Yeah. Okay. Maybe the more board you'll get I don't know. What do you want to do? Do you want to find something interesting to do? There is nothing interesting here. I mean for a while you're here. Okay. I don't think it's different. Let's say the boredom here or the boredom at work. The difference is that we have a much better we have controlled conditions here so that we can really get to learn about boredom. But boredom is quite fascinating by the way. It is. It's not boring at all if you're willing to look at it. So step number one is let's say supposing as you just said you feel bored. Okay. Let's say there was a miniature interviewer inside of your head while you're at work. And it would say to you how do you know that you're bored? What do you mean how do I know that I'm bored? I said well you just said you're bored. How do you know? Well okay I'm droodling whatever it is drooling my footstepping. I'm looking at my watch. The content of my mind is I feel dull unhappy. There's a Gray quality to everything. My mind is fantasizing about all kinds of other exciting things. I'd rather be golfing or whatever. Okay fine. Then that's what you try to watch again. The fly caught on the fly paper is you bring your attention to exactly what you're feeling because that's the truth in the moment. The truth is you're bored right now. It doesn't have to be a condemnation on board. Now for many of us one of the reasons we have such a hard time with it is because we've been brought up to never be bored. We always have to be very creative and selfreliant and have all these endless projects. But sometimes we're bored. So can you open your heart to boredom? Can you allow boredom in because that's what's happening to you. That's the truth. It's not to fight with it to try to replace it with what you think would be interesting. Now as you know often we hate boredom. We just don't like what it feels like. Oh no here comes boredom. I just hate feeling that way. Okay so then you look at the resistance. It's not that you try to force the mind to get back to the boredom but really what's prominent at this point is not boredom. It's resistance to boredom. It's that you just don't want to feel those feelings. And it's that you slip in under and feel you try to learn what it feels like to not hate boredom. Do you see what I'm getting at? The restlessness? No. Good. I can see wherever it is the body is often easier to do because sometimes in the mind it's so powerful the mind cast a spell and we get caught up. But the body is more accessible. That's not what you want. A different answer though right? We see. Okay now we have a problem is that you want to get rid of boredom. You see it got me in deeper. I thought this technique would get me out of border. Think of awareness more as an aesthetic. You know what has helped me a lot is the attitude towards observation is more like a naturalist. Let's say someone who loves birds or who loves to see the sunrise sunset or loves to watch the ocean or looking at beautiful art or listening to beautiful music. It's not so instrumental just grasping it just experiencing it just as it is. Now one of the reasons it's so hard for us and why we don't see quotes results from our observation is because we're trying to get results with our observation. We're trying to use observation as a Ray gun. It's sort of like to shoot down boredom. And especially you've heard like well if you're really aware the boredom you'll see through it. You'll see it's impermanent. It lacks ownership. There's no self. It falls away. Oh great. And then you aim your awareness towards the boredom and it just gets stronger. Okay. But you have to. Part of the problem for most of us is we don't know how to observe. That is we've been brought up to observe with some instrumental value. That is we observe to make money or we observe to get make a deal or we observe to something in it for us. We don't know the art of pure observation to just see for the joy of it just to see for its own sake. It's like learning for it. Just to see what is boredom to really investigate it in a sense of the openness of a scientist of a real scientist. Now if you can learn to do that. And again what you have to see is when you're not doing that you'll come to pure observation by noticing how you're invested in looking and how you want to result from your looking. And it's been seeing that that starts to thin out just like the restlessness sends out by seeing it and becomes patience. Pure observation comes out of seeing how we're pushing objects around. We're trying to do something to them with awareness. Now if you don't do that awareness is very powerful. It's a very subtle energy. And have any of you seen that? That Burns things up? Krishna Murdy wrote a book. The title is called The Flame of Awareness. It's a very good term for what as awareness the more refined it becomes the more powerful it becomes. But it's not like you're trying to burn anything up. It's just the pure seeing. It has that effect. Now if you can stick with it sometimes what happens is you penetrate more deeply into boredom. And often you'll find that there are other things in there like aggression anger. You'll see that the boredom is a mask. I'm not saying always but I've certainly seen it sometimes. And if you penetrate once through the boredom and feel like there was something else cooking underneath there and that the boredom was a way a strategy a way of managing it. So you don't have to get in touch with something that was much more frightening maybe fear whatever it is suddenly you realize that boredom is a natural event. It's well worth looking at. Yes.", 'human_start_time': '0:57:19'}, {'talkname': '19890304-Larry_Rosenberg-UNK-blending_practice_with_life-1561', 'question_num': 'Question 6', 'url': '/talks/1561/19890304-Larry_Rosenberg-UNK-blending_practice_with_life-1561.mp3', 'display_name': 'Blending Practice With Life', 'date': '3/4/89 0:00', 'start_time': 4536170, 'content': "What if it's not other people or job or anything? What if it's your own lifestyle? That seems to be your old habits and lifestyle that tends to inhibit awareness because our lifestyle it's not the same as it is here. I understand it's not appropriate for at home. Yes. How do you know what is appropriate? Okay one very beautiful application of this practice is to scrutinize what you're calling your lifestyle. And if we put it into the form of a question it would be how do we actually live? Underline actually not? How do you think you live or how you would like to live or how someone else would like you to live. But how do I actually live? And the only way you can find that out is by paying attention. How do I wake up and how do I wake up and how do I eat? We've been doing it here. How do I walk and how do I do this? And you start to find out not these ideals not these images of our life. So we get back to that about the difference between self knowledge and self images. And so you have to have a strong stomach. Sometimes when you start to see how you actually live that as we say one thing we set all these goals in the morning for what we're going to accomplish. And then we don't do anything that would lead in that direction. I want to go to Pittsburgh Pennsylvania but we buy tickets for Colorado. We're not going to get there. In our practice there's a term called clear comprehension of purpose SATY sampagana. And that means awareness is very helpful there in that if there's something that we're attempting to do. If we've said this is what we're attempting to do awareness can help us. See are we doing that which actually leads to what we said we want to do it. You've been doing it in this retreat. Let's say you've set for yourself doing the walking meditation and you start to walk and suddenly the mind is out to lunch. It's all over. Well there's something saying no we decided we're going to do walking meditation. Oh that's right. Okay. So then you come back. So you're bringing into alignment what you say you're doing. You want to accomplish with what you're actually doing. Does it lead to it? And more and more you begin to see that now in terms of meditation to give you a few examples once you start to value awareness let's say as the most precious thing there is awareness. It's not just some little psychological faculty because as it gets deeper you'll see that you are awareness in the truest sense. If you're anything you're awareness. And the Buddha is the fulfillment of awareness. Buddha just pure knowing. Now once you begin to respect that let's say you begin to value a meditative living and we all do what we wouldn't be here but I mean really value it. You start to understand that it's as important as making it for lunch or other things that we never have doubts about. When you get home you'll see that at least for most of us we'll forget to sit but we won't forget to go to breakfast or lunch or there are other things like that. Now what if we begin to really genuinely value a life of awareness? Then a lot of the things we do we begin to see. Does this hamper the practice of meditation? Is it an impediment or does it enhance it? Let me give you the most obvious example that comes to mind. Let's say you eat you begin to eat. And if you remember was suggested as you begin to pay attention to how you eat you may start to learn that certain foods contribute to the mind being more agitated that hindrance more restless. Other foods contribute to the mind being more dull and sleepy. That's another hindrance. These are some of the hindrances that Norion talked about. And also the quantity of course if we eat a lot we don't have any blood for our brain. It's all in the tummy. And then what happens? Well we know what the sitting after lunch is like right? All of us. So that now it is possible because many of us have done this to overeat eat the wrong food then sit down with the cushion go like that and then say I'm never going to overeat again. It's just awful. And terrible. I hate the feeling of being on the cushion wasting my time here. The Buddha was an awakened one. Here am I sleeping? And then it comes time to eat again. And we start with you. We go through the same thing. Then we come back to the cushion. I'm never going to do this again because I see when I overeat and I get sleepy and I go this is not a meditative life. I'm not a good Yogi and I'm just like over it's. Like in my own case I did that at an Indian restaurant. Narrator was witnessed to this. I don't know how long this took. Was it years? I don't know what. Yeah it would be something would go something like this. We'd go in we'd eat the food it would taste good and it would be with me for hours. I'd say Boy that food tastes good. But what you go through if it's just not worth it want to go to an Indian restaurant? Sure. Finally the day came. Like I get it. Indian restaurant equals suffering for me. I have nothing against Indian rest. Okay. Now that's wisdom in action that is our practice is taking advantage of the law of cause and effect. It's really learning. It's just bringing intelligence into our life. It seems that when I do this I get that I suffer. When I don't do that it seems oh it's more reasonable. Well food is an obvious one but more and more you're going to begin to see other things. Now the Buddha lists a few for example regarding the factors of enlightenment these equalities of mind that contribute very strongly to an awakened mind. And in almost all of them what he says is for example if you want to develop the quality of equanimity hang out with people who are very relaxed and who are at peace not with people who are all over the place and restless. If you want to let's say develop certain moral qualities like honesty. Don't hang out with people who are lying cheating stealing and killing all the time. Be with people who really are strong that way whatever the quality is. And so you begin to see it's humbling. You realize I'm not Superman or Superwoman and that it seems like the conditions that I'm in influence me a lot. So I'll do my best to be in conditions. I'm a young meditator. I'm just like a delicate little plant. I need protection. So I'm going to avoid situations that seem to destroy things. Now you have to be careful with that because you live in the world and much of the time we can't control it. We have to be with who we have to be with. And so there we then have to learn about our reactions. And that's what I meant. The problem of living in a world of non meditators it's not really a joke. Most of the world is not going to meditate ever. I feel pretty confident in that. They're just not going to. And so that means that they're not going to investigate they're not going to develop Samati. They're not going to do any of the things that perhaps you're beginning to see as valuable. That means they're going to lose their temper immediately. They're going to be very possessive. They're going to be very grabby all these things and they can't help it. That's the normal. That's the way. We all aren't aren't we that way now? Well let's say little by little some of that thins out but the world keeps rolling on it keeps not meditating. And so if we set it up in such a way that we become so precious and so pure that the only people that we'll be with are those people who've done at least five three months retreats only eat sprouts do Tai Chi and we won't even get on the same bus with anyone who's done well it's going to be a little bit constrictor to use your expression lifestyle maybe one more and then. Oh for me too. Okay. Well you're only asking the biggest question. I can help you get started because let's say right now pinch yourself real hard. Did you feel that you were aware of that? Right. It starts there. It starts very simply. You feel that a sound like if you're hearing my voice and you really hear it you were aware of that sound. And now what we're doing is we're practicing. You could make this distinction. We're practicing attention. Let's say we're aiming our attention at something. Let's say we're doing the walking meditation. We're able to do that. Let's practice that again. You could pick different words to mean this but I'm just picking attention. It's confusing when you read the literature because the words are used differently. So let's say the foot raises up and we're practicing attention to it. So we get better at that. So one use is just of the intentional practice of paying attention to what we're experiencing in the moment. And then sometimes the word awareness is used in a different way. I'm using it more as meaning it all anything awareness could mean. It's not something you can practice. It's something suddenly you find yourself in it. There is awareness. Now of course I can't report to you the far reaches of the journey because I'm not a Buddha. But what I can tell you is that at some point you may even have an inkling of it. Now you'll see that you are awareness. You're the knowing. Because not only that that's what sets us free. Awareness sets things right. For example any of the qualities that bother us anything that you've brought up tonight when you're aware of it that means in a sense you've stepped out of the problem. There's just you've stepped into something else where you're not being victimized by that. Now before you've identified with the object. And in the process of identification with the object you suffer the fate of that object. So that what you'll start to see. And it can at some point it can get quite frightening or the idea gets frightening. Hey wait a minute then who am I? And that's what I meant the other evening is that at a certain point whatever comes up it's not so much who am I as it's who I aren't. You start to see that no matter what it is I'm not that now the Hindus have a practice nor is whatever it is. It's not that because it's an idea it's a concept. In Vedanta they have a technique. It's very similar to what we're doing. And they call it Netti. Netti. And what that means is no matter what turns up their frame of reference is more God. And no matter what turns up it means that's not God. And then something else that's not God that's not God. And so our path is sometimes called via Negativa the negative way. By that it doesn't mean it's not negativity. What it means is we let go of but you come to the supreme whatever you want to call that through letting go. Instead of trying to get to God or trying to get to enlightenment you let go of ignorance. You let go of. And it's sort of like a strip tease in a way. You just keep dropping things and dropping things and dropping things. And at a certain point you have to drop the dropping because you get very attached to that. And so the far reaches of it have to do with the fact that in a certain sense we're nobody we're absolutely no one. What we're back to those Rabbi again bragging about what a nobody they are. And yet there's a conventional life that has to be lived. And so that gets lived out. But what if we didn't get attached to all the things that we think we are that we just functioned. In other words we functioned happily without building a status out of everything that we did our job. We did it with excellence I hope but we didn't make a doer out of it. Not only is the job getting done but we have to give it some kind of status ranking. It's done professionally. The sociologists tell us every few years how the occupations stack up like professor was almost the highest. And then it dropped a little. Then it goes up high and cab driver drops down here. You can actually find out your value if I just ask a sociologist but can we really? What this is saying is we're all the same value. Once you let go of the attachment to all these social indicators then we all are the same. Your mind and my mind is the same. If you're thinking and attach to thinking and I'm doing the same we're very different. You're this and I'm of that and we'll even go to war over it. But as we go deeper what we have in common becomes more and more obvious. And I don't mean just to have a body and a heart. That is whatever you want to call it.

Great. I think you should continue to talk. I'm not there yet. I'm not anyone here. If kind of call it a practice rather than meditation because people get these ideas. Again. This is the second time around. I started reading about the body and. It was so clear to me what I was doing. Right. You know what? You lost it to Cyberspace but you're fortunate you did. No I think so. Leave her alone. I've been down that road. I think we all have. It doesn't work. But there's other help on the way. In fact it's here. There's a very fine book called Mindfulness in plain English by Bante Gunara Sri Lankan Monk. And he really goes to great pains. And it's just extraordinarily clear about what this mindfulness stuff is. But let me just give you the gist of it some of it and then it would be a useful book to read. And if your daughter shows some interest then this wouldn't be a bad book for her read. I think there's too much in my book. 16 Petra Driver Crazy. Okay mindfulness. First of all it's preconceptual. It's not an idea. It's more like a clear mirror. It just sees what's there. Mindfulness only happens in the present time. That's the only time it can ever happen. Mindfulness as a mirror is not for or against what it sees. Real mindfulness here. The mirror shows the palm of my hand. I turn it around it shows the back of my hand. I take this away. It shows you Brad. Okay so we're developing a quality. It's already there. Everyone has it. If you're human. We have this unique ability as we live out our life. All of us are living out our life. We also have the capacity to be sensitive to what that experience of living out our life is. So we already have the mindfulness. It's not like you picked it up here at CIMC. What the Buddha is teaching us how to do is how to develop it refine it apply it so that it becomes extraordinarily really clear like an electronic microscope if you need to go small and like a telescope if you need to go big. And we have that capacity. And it's like any other art. If you practice it it gets refined and it's all about clear seeing. So it's non conceptual. It's not for against. It only happens now. And it's reflective. It shows what's there. And it turns out that that's very useful. One of the main things it shows is that everything that arises passes away. And read the book. It's useful. Oh good. Okay. You sound fine about your daughter though. I mean there is really many of us have really learned this. One time I learned it with my parents. Don't pedal Buddhism. Be a Buddha. It's quite a difference. Don't convince her of anything. Don't feel she's got to join. Oh that's right. Okay. Well there are other books that have less Buddhism with a capital B in it that might be more appropriate for her. John Kabat Zinn's work. Yeah. And Bontegunaratna's book is a very very useful introduction that might help her. But sounds like you're doing fine. Yeah please. Yes of course. But in the Buddhist teaching this comes up all the time because people will start and they hear this teaching and then people become absolute about it and they'll say oh my God I really like this stuff. Like you're getting attached to the practice. You better not do that. You better stop. I wouldn't worry about that. No let that attachment not only be there but let it get stronger. The time will come where in a sense you let go of that to move to an even more refined place. But if you let for example people hear about seeing through the suffering that is caused by ego attachment this self this preoccupation we have with ourselves. And so from day one you want to let go of it or you feel well the only reason I'm coming to this meditation is to satisfy the ego. I want to be calmer. I want to be more clear. Don't be too hard on yourself. You have to start somewhere. You can't lift yourself up by your own bootstraps. And so whatever energy gets you here I don't mean literally CMC gets you to meditate gets you to the cushion get you to look at yourself to me is useful. Then the time comes when that in a sense itself destructs or you see the need for there's something about it now that's actually holding you back. And so at a certain point there is a practice called the practice of no practice. You don't do that on day one. All the techniques and methods and even the teachings of the Buddha give you a headache. That doesn't mean they're bad because they may have gotten you to a place that's extraordinary in life. It's just that their vehicles their crutches their water wings their training wheels there are things that we need to help us. Americans want to go right to as soon as they find out oh there's a method that's just the method of no method. I want that right away. It doesn't work that way. It would be like putting a three year old on a Harley Davidson whatever. They need a three Wheeler for goodness sakes. I don't mean to be. It's all us. But eventually your point is well taken but you don't have to be in a hurry to let go of it. So in the Buddhist teaching he's talked about this where certain kinds of attachments become more and more subtle. You let go of the more coarse ones over time and then there are more subtle ones that you pick up and then more subtle ones until finally even the teaching itself even the teaching itself which becomes attachment to views and opinions becomes a burden. But you don't throw something away until you have it. We don't have it yet. We don't have any. Like I hear people talking now see the Buddha just kill the Buddha. They heard this teaching. If you meet the Buddha on the mountain what you do kill the Buddha sounds good but that's actually quite an advanced practice. What it means is the concept of the Buddha that's holding you back. But it may have taken you quite a ways to help you be inspired and learn some things. And there's a process that's been followed by thousands over 2500 years that makes some sense. And each one of us has to work with it in our own way. We need the Buddha right now and the day will come when he'll just be as one teacher called Golden Tongue Blabbermouth. But right now let's weigh his words with respect and use them. We need to hear some wise words and later on we see the Buddha coming. We just want to get out of the way. He's going to start him with another sermon about how to live. Am I making any sense? The Buddha there's the final on that. The Buddha has a famous image which is if you need a raft to get to the other shore let's say you take the raft and then you get from one side of the shore to the other side. When you get to the shore you don't run around carrying the raft on your back. You put it down it got you to where you need it to go. Thank you very much. And now you don't have to cart it around anymore. It's something like that. Yeah. Please. There's no room anymore for painting art music out. I don't know about that. I think painters go through quite a bit of an ordeal and hard work based on what they have some friends and so many things are scrapped until I get it right. But are you a writer? Yeah. Okay. There needs to be a problem. It has to do with knowing what you're doing. It's not that let's say even sometimes people will put it in terms of does this mean I can never have a fantasy again? You have to know when a fantasy is happening that it's happening particularly if you're a literary person. Some of these images that the mind produces are useful for you. Look I use it too. I wrote something. I had to use thinking. It's not that thinking is bad or your word was a fabrication to create a world let's say and let's say good art. We know that the words are not yet the best novel is not life. It's about life. But somehow a really good one really helps us go deeper into ourselves let's say a great dustoevsky. It helps us understand ourselves a lot better et cetera. So there's a place for thinking actually is quite a magnificent human function. The problem is to begin with we're enslaved to thinking and we worship thinking. We have given tremendous authority to thinking and we equate thinking with life itself often. And it's unexamined. So that thinking is doing us. Thinking is telling us what the world is and we think we're seeing the world. So that has produced tremendous suffering. People kill each other over different thoughts. Ideologies. And it's pretty obvious. But now here you are a writer and a meditator. There have been many writers and meditators. When you practice when you meditate that means let's say when you sit thoughts that come up you don't start writing while you're sitting. Now even there there are exceptions now. And then a creative burst comes to know and saying Stamp that out. You're not going to do it anyway. You're going to probably write it down or make a note in the corner of your mind. But by and large what is it you're doing in the given moment? And if it's let's say sitting and being with the breathing if that's your practice in that moment then that's not a time to be writing a novel or whatever kind of writing you do. But let's say when you sit down to write a novel meditation can help you. For example you start to write. And it's very common among writers that there's a blockage right? Suddenly you're dry. Nothing comes and you panic or you get discouraged or even depressed. Those are good moments to practice. You don't have to jump onto a cushion. Just stay right at your computer if that's how you write and just be with what's happening right there. As you learn how to do that you take the power out of it. It tends to fall away. And actually you have a fresh energy that comes from not attaching to the apprehension or the fear or the disappointment or the discouragement. When it falls away there's a kind of vitality that comes in its wake from the letting go from seeing through it. And then you then approach what your writing is with a fresh mind. It's quite commonplace. People who have been sitting for a while and doing writing of one sort or another who've talked to me about it. And I know it in a small way for myself. When the mind learns how to get really silent that means no thoughts but you're not in Dreamland. It's another dimension that most of us don't even know exists. But it's accessible. It's available. The method is to take you there resting in that silence. Something happens in that silence. It's not dead. It's highly charged very subtle form of life. And then when you come out of that you may find that your writing is different. It's inspired or you're painting or sculpting or dancing or whatever your art form is. So it's not one versus the other. It's keep your practice strong. And when it's time to write just write. And when it's time to sit just sit. Do you see what I'm getting at? Then you're not meditating anymore. But even those of us who are not writers do that. It's not as well turn the phrase. Do you think it's impossible right now? Yes I would use the word difficult would be more accurate. Impossible? Not at all. It goes something like this. It's different for each person of course in general thought is very very subtle little package of energy and it has immense power which we give it. That's why it has the power. It's just a thought. It's just blah blah blah. Even the most refined brilliant thought it's just a thought but we give it energy over ourselves and we've been doing that for a long time. So it's very powerfully conditioned. And then you hear someone say well just be mindful of thinking what happens and you try to do it and you can't. So what you're saying is accurate? Certainly. I think anyone who meditates knows exactly what you're talking about. It's a bit like this. The image train of thought in the culture we use that phrase. So let's say you're on the platform. Awareness is on the platform. The image may break down but it might be a little bit of some help. So a train comes in train of thought comes in. Don't get on the train. Of course typically what happens. And that's why you're saying it's difficult. The train comes in and before we know it we're headed someplace. We may not even be where we want to go but there we are on the train. And then with practice you wake up. Suddenly you're 2 miles out of the station and you jump off like in the movies. I don't know if real people ever do it but it seems like stunt. People know how to do it. And then you come back to this with time. The train pulls up high there and you don't get on. Now it's not impossible. It comes with practice. One reason it's so difficult is thought is such a subtle form of energy as you put it. It's correct. The body is much more coarse. And I don't mean that in the derogatory sense. Just descriptively more accessible more available. The breath is a mood is an emotion is a thought. They're like that. And we've had so much practice giving them power which then comes back on us that little by little. For example two things can help you. At least two. One is begin to understand the nature of thought. Just what is a thought when it happens? Begin to see that thoughts are actually quite limited. It's like skyriding drink Garlic's milk. Maybe there's something people get very passionate about it and start crying. Garlic's milk. I love that milk. But most of us just watch it go through the sky and we don't even finish. We glance and we go on to something else. Thoughts are like they're just stuff. They come and go there quite insubstantial now. They may not feel that way now but their power is like they cast a spell over us. And that's what you're saying. I'm putting a different language out. That is we tend to be aware of it and suddenly we're enveloped in it. Isn't it? Something like that? In other words don't look for trouble. No. Okay. But let me extract a little bit of wisdom from what you just said. It's wiser than you know. Let's say thoughts come through the mind. And those you've practiced for a while tell me if I'm just ranting and raving. Let's say mindfulness is directed at thinking and it just falls apart. Let's say sentences start out. They're just a bunch. No sentence finishes. There's a bunch of broken words sort of like every fourth word. And makes no sense because awareness touches it. And suddenly the mind. There's no thought. That's what you're getting at. The reason that happens. Thoughts are really not that substantial. That's what I've been trying to say. When they get burned up in that flame of attention. Now when you aim awareness at a physical pain awareness is an energy. The more you practice it the more refined and subtle that energy becomes. And when awareness touches physical pain doesn't that change too? At least sometimes yes. Okay that's all right. But let's not make it a fighting kind of thing. Whatever mindfulness touches it affects it mindfulness. If you try to use mindfulness to get a result then it's not really mindfulness to get back to what you were talking. If you're using mindfulness to get somewhere with it it's no longer a corner of the mind is too goal oriented. It's trying to get somewhere so you're not fully attentive. Okay. So thoughts when you direct awareness to them. Fall away. Now as you get really good at that that's a direct highway into silence. The thoughts fall away. Fall away. And finally you're looking at the source of where thoughts come out of and where they go back to. But that's the direction the practice is going in. Do you see what I'm getting at? Yeah I do. So it's not a problem. But often people thinking is so much authority has been given to thinking that unless we can understand. Do you regret that you didn't get to know what the thought was trying to tell you? Good. Then you'd be on the express train. But there's some people who need to know. But what was it trying to think? It's sort of like a compulsion to know. It's like being a yentr you know what I mean? But about your own mind you've got to know all of your own business. He likes this and she likes that. I missed that one. I like who do I like? But after a while that becomes what's the point? It's just such a waste of energy. So what you're saying now is a little different than when I was directing my you're still not satisfied though. Okay. The practice is whatever it is you're doing to really do it. If you're filling out your taxes I would hope that you would totally concentrate on the figures. If you're writing I would hope that you really are writing. It's not that you sort of have to have someone over here watching you write or add up the figures. It's that there's undivided attention in it. Now with practice what does happen? In fact you probably have had this as writers definitely have this. There are moments when there's such an absorption in the writing that there is no ego. It feels as if the writing is coming out of you. It's writing itself. And those are some of the best creative moments. Well they happen not only in artistic creativity but suddenly a burst of brilliance where some thoughts start becoming very clear. The mind is quite smart but I think you're holding yourself to an unnecessary standard of sort of being mindful of this process while it's happening. But you see you're as awake to really write in the way in which I'm describing it. You are awake. You know that what is happening now is writing. It's a bit like this. Someone took one of our practice groups some years ago who was a city planner and he loved he was like you. He found his home The Passenger. And then at the end of ten weeks and he said he was so sad I said what's the problem? It seemed like this practice has been helping you. And he said Well yes but now I'm a city planner. That's my work. And you keep saying it's not about the future. There's no future there's no path. So the teachings have to be. It's not double talk. It's that if you're a city planner when the time comes to plan by all means plan. But know that that's what you're doing. The problem isn't that you can never think about a future. There'll be no envisioning of a future permitted in meditative circles and there's no past. We're not allowed to remember what happened. That's over with. It's just now a kind of new kind of thought fascism your mind fascism. It's not so much that it's that when let's say you're doing future let's say you're envisioning for a reason. You know that that's what you're doing. You're not lost in what you're doing. When you're reflecting on something that happened in the past you know that that's what you're doing. When you're writing you know that you're writing. It's not that you're fully in that activity. There's alertness there's attentiveness and there's a giving over of your best to it. It's not that you're pulling back and detached from it. Does that make any sense? You are holding yourself I think to too hard a burden. I don't think it would be very hard for you to do what you're I mean I understand you're taking it from the general instructions but mindfulness is still there. And that's where as you keep practicing and let's say you're writing and you've been practicing mindfulness over and over again it starts to become more natural more of a reflex and accompanies you without kind of intentionally deciding I'm going to be mindful now. It's just there. And so let's say you run into something some not some way in which you can't solve the problem. And I'm just taking a typical one that all of us run into and there's anxiety and fear. I don't know what the answer is to this. I can't seem to learn this. And certainly suddenly this happens more and more. The mindfulness will be your friend. It will come right in there and you'll know to look at in the body or however you're able to do it what's happened? And then as it weakens and falls away you get back to what is it that you're doing. There's a simple teaching that goes back to ancient times. When you walk when you sit sit never wobble. So when you're writing write do you see what I'm getting at? I don't think so. I mean you're not the best I can do. Yeah.

Oh the idea of Donna you mean. Yeah of giving I want to be. Able to use this process as part of not just walk around in a spit until I go to retreat. I want to use this. Why is this happening and use it. Yes I understand. Let's start right where you began that you have some resistance to this Donna stuff. Yes. Okay let's start there. The idea is that we're all Saints and training right? We give everything here. Take my house. You don't have a house. My car my husband wife. So start off. You're stingy. Let's face it. You can't help it. You're just stingy. You came out that way and self centered and self preoccupied. It's fine. It's okay. Nothing personal. I'm saying it for a point. You start where you are and where you are. You feel that resistance. I work hard for my money. I don't know what you know better than I do. In other words don't be in a hurry to do an impersonation of being a Saint or being this generous person. Start where you are. And where you are is for whatever reason. I don't mean that it's not good that you have resistance to. Donna you're being honest. I think it takes great courage at a place like this to get up in front of all these people and say that I hate to give. I know it's a hot night and I'm somewhat delirious. I did say I was very taken aback by it. It's not me. It's not who I like. I was really excited about it and I'm so taken aback by this reaction. But obviously this part of me somewhere. Yes but you see the training really is training and honesty. And look Donna it sounds nice to freely give to someone else. You know what the concept is right? So I don't explain it but it's a lifetime of purification. For real Donna. Real Donna. There's no giver and there's no one you're giving it to. And that's not where we begin. We begin as a giver. Sort of like I'm going to give this teacher. This is what a weekend with Bante Gunaratna? Yes. Okay good. He's a wonderful person and teacher. And let's say the idea would be oh he's a Monk and I'm giving him all of this. I'm paying for him because the teachers at IMS don't get anything other than the Donna you know that. The teachers get what you give them. You pay for your food and board for the weekend. Okay that sounds very nice and ideal. And you read it in books and you hear people talk about it and suddenly you feel contraction about that. You don't really feel totally good about it. You could use the word twit or whatever it was. Hey that's a good place to practice because it's a fact. Do you see what I mean? In spiritual circles we're drowning in idealism. It's one of the biggest obstacles to real development. Is idealism. I don't know. That may sound. I'm not advocating cynicism. What it is is that if the idealism is really strong we set up a notion as to who it is we want to be and then we try to be that. Let's say I'll give you the most the example I know best the anti war movement which I participated in. The name itself gives it away. We were antiwar. There was so much violence in those meetings about what the right way to do it how to protest. Okay. To really be successful. We were all at war ourselves with ourselves with each other. Step number one would be can you even be at peace with yourself? You want the world to be at peace and you can't even be at peace with yourself just alone in the room. You're at war with yourself now. You come with people all of whom are your friends and who share your value. But war is no good and you're even with them you're at each other's throat. So you got a picture of Gandhi over your bed. I'm being personal now. When I was growing up I did. And I found when I was in the army that I liked a lot of that stuff. Crawling on the ground with my machine gun and getting a little bang bang bang and getting a little medal for it. It was like being kid again. And then I saw it and I was revolted by it. But the starting point was that I liked it. And then I was revolted by what was coming out of me. I was just a normal American kid who liked that stuff. Okay so it's good. What you were saying is good because it's true. If that's what's there practice is always going to be like that. I'm not saying don't have any ideals but what can happen is people drown in their ideals and they never deal with ones underneath it. The ideal just takes you to the surface the conscious level whereas really we have to go much deeper to the unconscious level where you could be officially take what happened with Gandhi. It's a wonderful example of it. It's been well documented. Gandhi did a lot of work on himself tremendous. A lifetime of deep inner work and he could lead an entire nation to be nonviolent and to kick the British out as soon as he was assassinated. It was a blood bath because most of the people were not at his level. They were held together by his power his moral strength. They had not done the same degree of inner work. Do you see what I'm getting? So you're off to a good start if you can not be judgmental about discovering oh my goodness I'm not too comfortable with this Donna idea. And all you have to do is just gently slip it under and be aware of it and let it be. Let it happen. Do you see what I'm getting at? That's good practice. It isn't just always getting peace and the quality of being able to face your demons or stuff that you don't approve of officially. What I was saying I think I've said it more than once tonight. The ability to enlarge your capacity to receive your own experience. I think many of us quoting myself might have a hard time receiving if I saw. I don't really want to give to. I think quickly I'd find a way around that or over it and suddenly a very nice impulse with wallpaper over it. But for practice to go deep you have to look at what is just the way things Dharma means the way things are. And if you can it's a good habit to get into. I gather you're pretty early in your practice or. No. Yeah. That's relatively new. But don't throw this one out. Practice with it.", 'human_start_time': '0:53:00'}, {'talkname': '20000809-Larry_Rosenberg-CIMC-discussion_on_practice-8142', 'question_num': 'Question 3', 'url': '/talks/8142/20000809-Larry_Rosenberg-CIMC-discussion_on_practice-8142.mp3', 'display_name': 'Discussion On Practice', 'date': '8/9/00 0:00', 'start_time': 3597164, 'content': "No I don't want to.

That I'm supposed to be doing. But they all require meetings and I have received my resistance to these meetings. Just going up and up and up and up and up. Then I see of course the only judgment coming in over to trying work. What's the behavior? I know that one. Well yes. And I don't. And I've actually dropped out of some organizations that I feel are very worthy ones just because I have such resistance to what goes on in the meeting. My see all of this and I'm trying not to judge it. Yes. But at the same time it's translating into behavior which I'm not sure is very useful. I understand sometimes the resistance would have wisdom in it and you've used that one up it's over and it's time to move on from that particular whatever it is in this case what you're talking about. At other times you can't move on. Let me give you an example. If you think to make a center like this run. Michael Norien and I are the three people who do the teaching here. We have meetings. We have a lot of meetings. To get this building renovated. It nearly killed us. We had to have meetings so often with the architects with the builders with this with that going to City Hall. Even without that in order to run a center. I hate meetings. I always have. I mean it's not new for me. I can't stand them. The thing I'm most allergic to is Buddhist conferences. Nothing more boring than a Buddhist conference. Okay. But now let's come back to CIMC. So sometimes it's a blend of reflection plus observation. And I've looked at some of my resistance and Michael Norie and I have talked it over. I don't think they'll mind me sharing it because it's right to your point. And fortunately the three of us know that we'd like to use our energies in different ways. Is there a way of having fewer meetings but not affecting the quality of care for CIMC? And so we're examining and of course we're starting to find ways that we can have fewer meetings. But then you get to a point where no these meetings do have to happen if you want a place to really work you've got to be up to date. You've got to know what's going on. You've got to know what the yogis are. And so there sometimes you feel the resistance. We just had one Tuesday and I felt the resistance. Our meetings at 1030. I live two blocks away and suddenly I could feel a stronger hold on my neck. I'd rather do anything than that. And so my starting point was not to overpower the Resistance and March dutifully to see IMC on behalf of serving the Dharma. But I started what who said thank you. Okay. So I looked at the Resistance and acknowledged the fact that this is not something to be honest with you. I don't want to do it. It's like what you were saying but then you'd say it translates into behavior. And then it got weaker. And I stood there but then the reflection was it's a bit like often you have to do a lot of things in life you don't want. Parenting is something the parents love everything they have to do. I'm sure they don't but they do it because they love their children. So I could say we love the center and we want the center to be a good place for all of us to practice. And so sometimes we swallow hard and we go to the meeting anyway. So it's sort of no one solution. It may be that certain kinds of those meetings are over for you. You're never going to do them again. And even if you examine them you realize it's all right that you could use your energy a lot better for some other and then some of them. You may conclude that not from an egotistical point of view like how important you are. But you may conclude it's really necessary.", 'human_start_time': '1:00:31'}, {'talkname': '20000809-Larry_Rosenberg-CIMC-discussion_on_practice-8142', 'question_num': 'Question 5', 'url': '/talks/8142/20000809-Larry_Rosenberg-CIMC-discussion_on_practice-8142.mp3', 'display_name': 'Discussion On Practice', 'date': '8/9/00 0:00', 'start_time': 3919602, 'content': "To go to this one. And that then how to skillfully come from the Resistance to getting to the meeting without it being brutal. So you're not brutalizing yourself marching yourself overpowering yourself with just sheer will. And for me just as one time anyway it was a combination of seeing into the Resistance which was quite strong and then it thinned out and then reflecting on what it is we had to do for that hour and a half on Tuesday. And knowing full well that it's important there's no one else can do it. We have to do it. Somehow it just fell away. And I went. And actually the meeting was okay. So there's no Pat answer. So sometimes the resistance has wisdom in it and no matter how you see that you do have to do it even though there's resistance and other times it's telling you it's not necessary anymore. But I can't go beyond that. It's too personal. It's for you from here on in please. Okay. About work. Yes. And I had this experience of hearing people find and saying whining just work. But the experience was your kill hop. It was kill the winding kill the concept of work and just do the task. Because the task itself is not that unpleasant. It's all the stuff you bring along with it. That's right. Okay. But you have to be careful that you don't stop whining about the whiners. Yeah good. Because we tend to nothing personal. We tend to favor ourselves. Have you noticed? And so somehow the mind is like a brilliant defense lawyer and it has ways of finding everything out except a numero Uno. Okay but let's go to that situation. I think you're quite right. Let's say you have a job and a job would be like going to a meeting or raising children or whatever. And instead of whining why not examine what that's all about? Because you're going to do it anyway. Probably. So you have a choice. You can do it. Dragging your feet exhausting yourself and bringing everyone else down making work drudgery and all the rest of it or in examining it. And that would start with let's say for a whiner let's say one of the whiners would start to meditate. They would have to look at their whining and see well what does this accomplish? Shift back to selfishness. I was just kidding before. But let's say people do find that they just want to preserve everything and they don't like to give really is not about you. When you look at it the reason to be generous is not necessarily because Buddha said so or Jesus said so. A self centered selfish life doesn't work out to be all that happy. It turns out you isolate yourself people stay away from you and then you wonder why I'm so lonely. Well you've done it to yourself by protecting your resources and hoarding and all the rest of it so that sometimes you break out of it because of wisdom. You realize this is just not a good way to live. Whereas when you share when you find yourself able to give to people you find love material whatever it is you find that the quality of life improves. You're the greatest beneficiary of the generosity. But it's something that you learn from your experience. It's not a should because some wise person told you to do it. It's not a commandment. Do you see what I'm getting at? So to get back to this is similar. In that moment was understanding that the issue that I was having was my own aversion. Yes. To whining. To whining. And sometimes to doing a particular kind of a pass. Yes. And so then I could explore the aversion and figure out is there something about it that should change or is it just on a motion and let it go and do it? Okay. But I get your practitioner right. Okay. So you have certain resources that perhaps your fellow winers don't have right? Yeah. Okay. But you'll have to live in that atmosphere and so you have to kind of see how it's affecting you so that you can decontaminate so you don't get contaminated by it. But let me leave you both with a general Dharma teaching for all of us. And then a particular example that comes from my experience with meditators who come to this center. One is in addition to this hot Buddha cold Buddha teaching which try it see if it doesn't make life a lot easier for you. There's a teaching by a Japanese nMaster named Dolgen and it's instructions to the Cook. So on one level he's giving instructions at this monastery as to how Cook should behave in this monastery. But it's really much deeper than it's about that. But it also is how to Cook your life to make it short. A lot of what he's saying is that whatever ingredients you have make the best meal that you can with it. That's practice armour practice. So for example if you have lots of really good ingredients loads of vegetables organic not modified genetically you bought out bread and circus. You got everything. And not only that the Emperor is coming with a full retinue. And it's celebratory. The monastery flags are flying and drums and chanting. It's a great event. So of course the cooks are all inspired. They got great ingredients and they're making it for this entourage of important people. And a wonderful meal comes out of it. And then the next day the Emperor is gone. Most of the good ingredients are gone. There's some wilted Greens and a stale carrot. And there you are in the same old dreary. Monks and nuns walk coming into eat. You don't have the same interest. You just throw something together. Okay Darma teaching is to have respect for everything you do. Nothing is trivial or worthless. Nothing. It's essentially learning how you're more alive when you live that way. It's not like being righteous or self righteous. It's that in each moment that's what your life is. If you're spending your life whining you're the one who's losing because you're qualifying the quality of that life your life in that moment in this teaching. The next day what you would do is you take a look of what ingredients you have and there this carrot and some wilted Greens and some used rice Brown rice of course. And you have all this stuff. It's not much. And the audience are the same old people that you've seen year in and year out. And of course the last ingredient is the mind of the Cook. And you see well what am I bringing to this meal? And you see that it's no enthusiasm. Let's just get this over with. There's nothing happening here. Practice would be to slip out from under that and to make the very best meal you can with the ingredients that you have because that's what your life is in that moment. So it would improve work life for everyone if they had that simple teaching. But of course you have to make it viable. You have to practice it. And you start off with resistances and not liking and whining and all the rest of it. And are you willing to take a look at that a concrete example of it which has happened a number of times to people that I've you know when you teach Dharma a certain way it's a good fortune. The word blessed is overused anyway. It's good fortune because people openly and sincerely share their lives with you. And so you kind of get a glimpse as to how other people are living. And there are two kinds of experiences that have been shared to me from work. One people who are waiters and waitresses and one taxicab drivers. And I'm going to again make a composite. Essentially what they're saying is I'm not really a waiter or a waitress. I'm not really a cab driver. I'm a ballet dancer. I'm a writer. I'm a filmmaker. Well how long have you been driving a cab? 20 years. You're a cab driver who likes to write. I don't mean that in a negative sense. And then at first this is a concrete of saying you've been doing this for 20 years and you talk about it as if it's nonexistent and that who you really are. Is this worker this writer. I think you have to acknowledge that this is a real chunk of your life that you're doing day in and day out. So then if we bring over that teaching of making the best meal you can you have to reinvent being a cab driver. You kind of look into the situation and see if you can find a way of redefining what it means to drive so that you see there are actually some very useful wonderful aspects of driving. It's a service. You're helping people often when they really need it. Sometimes they talk to you. You're like a priest. You hear them on the way to the airport. They know they're never going to see you again. And they tell you some stuff that they feel better and often they don't talk to you but you get a glimpse of how other people live because you can't help but hear them in the back et cetera et cetera. However you do it is to see if you can't enliven it to make it something that is viable. The same with let's say waiting table. Often it's a special time. People come to eat a meal together. You have a way of enhancing that situation. Do you see what I'm getting at? So you start looking for what's right about the situation and tried to emphasize that rather than getting fixated on one facet of life to the negation of everything else the extreme example if you have patience and then we're all released from this bondage. Have you ever heard of the flyingwell Enders? If you haven't because the main one is dead and the stories about how he died. They were tightrope walkers a family of world famous. They would just walk way up there. And one night some years ago I turned on the news and I'm watching TV and there is Mr. Wilenda the head flying Wilenda. And he scheduled it wasn't the news. It was some show about in South America somewhere. And he's supposed to or it was a footage of it I really don't remember. And he was advised not to do it because it was outdoors. And there was this tremendous Gale tremendous wind. But he said no I'm going to do it. And you see him I'm chomping on my tofu and organically grown tomato sandwich whole grain bread. And there goes this Lenda walking. And you see him blown to his death. Okay now to back up a little he made this famous statement which is what practice is not. He said all of life is waiting. The only thing that's real for me is when I'm on the high wire. You think about it. We're not so different from him. For one person it might be the piano or tennis or we have our areas photography or whatever. It is where we really are happy and we love to do it. But what about most of the life? Let's say if you fall in love with meditation some people do you know but most of your life is not going to be spent on the cushion. So are you going to become like the flying on retreats? Just put me in IMS CIMC any place meditation pad and cushions. And I'm just a happy camper. And as soon as the retreat is over all I can think about is how to get back to that next retreat how to earn the money to get there. And all I talk about is like a combat ribbon how that retreat was. And I sat for two weeks and it was really hard. In the meantime life is most of our time is spent cooking taking out the garbage talking listening crossing the street. So practice has a lot to do with that. It's not just sitting on the cushion. Please understand that those of you who are new and sitting on the cushion learning how to do that is also special. It's not special. And it is special. It's special because it's such a simplified human invention. However this got invented you have no other responsibility. You're not talking or eating or writing or phoning or watching. You're just stuck with yourself. The form is designed to utterly simplify your existence. So there you are with yourself. We start off seemingly in an innocuous way with the breathing. But as those of you who come here know it soon expands well beyond the breathing to include your full experience. So it's a wonderful brilliant invention to help human beings. But if you get fixated on it attached to it in some ultimate way so that you divorce it from the rest of your life. The flying will end up then I don't know what's been accomplished. You become like a hot house plant. Something like that. What I have found and I look back after I retrieve six eight nine months into practice at home after the retreat I look back over the last six eight nine months and what I realized was today my life is different than the most before I started this practice because I'm different and my life feels better. Yeah right. When it's time to sit just sit when it's time to write just right it's time to walk the high wire. Walk the high wire but not me. Okay can we have a few moments of silence please? May we continue to look into ourselves? May we see things exactly as they are and may such clear direct seeing us from all forms of limitation.

Was a political candidate. For some of you who just got born please greed hatred and delusion is the problem according to the Buddha. But all right what are you going. To talk about with the whys. You take into account what wise people might counsel you about. For example here's the Buddha. You see if that warrant. So what's the point in all these teachings? In other words look just find out for yourself. Get out of here. Use awareness follow the breath develop a steady calm mind. Come back in about 25 years and let me know how you did. So. All it means is that it's not to dispense with wisdom but it's to use them properly. Does that make sense? It doesn't look convincing to me. Well you take it into account but he isn't. The final authority is what I'm saying. Nor is the Buddha. The Buddha is not the final authority. You are which doesn't mean you can't be devoted to these teachings. That's why I love these teachings because I'm happy to be treated as an adult. What it is usually saying is my happiness and my unhappiness. Hey look over here. So I enjoy that challenge. Personally I've spent enough of my life not doing it. The problem is out there. But at any rate you don't have to agree with it. But what it means is you don't throw away for example books but you don't sort of cite them as the final authority. For example supposing someone's much wiser than us then wouldn't it be sensible to let's say they've meditated much longer than we have and they've made some of the mistakes that we're just learning about. Couldn't it be helpful to kind of draw them out and say this is what's going on? What do you think? But it doesn't mean it's not handing over your total integrity to someone. What's the second one? There was a Japanese story of a guy one of those wise guys walking in and he sees a little baby in the road and he doesn't stop. To help it because he says this. Guy'S Karma has to be really heavy. And he's a little baby at Batman. And I was thinking about Batman. Exactly what would you do if you passed that baby on the road? That's what's important. That's what you would do. Apparently in this story that isn't what happened but that's the story. What you do is much more interesting to me because then you have it. Now what? Sure. In other words the possibility of taking this advice and misusing it. That's what I was getting at. You have to do the best you can. When you decide what is beneficial and what isn't for myself and others you can't wait until your perfect life would be over. And so you have to do the best you can and learn from what comes out of it. See the difference? As far as I can tell one of the main differences is the ability to learn from our mistakes. Some people make no mistakes. They just don't. They've never apologized. They're never wrong. They just don't. I mean they're just born that way. Incredible. They're really lucky. But self knowing has to do. That's what I meant. It takes a certain courage or boldness at a certain point. Even you understand that the journey is enjoyable of selfdiscovery. The reason what your example is a good one is because self deception is so powerful in us that we're deceived over and over again. And we use a vocabulary that sounds very good. But sometimes what it takes is life has to give us a real hard whack before we wake up and see it. We just don't get it. Some of us just don't get it until some tragedy hits and then even then we don't get it. But the main thing is you. What would you do with that child? As the mind gets clearer you have a better chance. As self knowing matures you have a better chance of not kidding yourself or saying something is beneficial when it really isn't. See it's an ongoing learning process. Can I give you a personal example? I was part of the psychedelic generation and we were on the cutting edge of LSD and peyote and all of it. And for us it was an eye opener. I was being trained as a psychologist at very intellectual training. And I didn't know that there were whole realms of consciousness that I literally was cut off from because my conceptual mind was somewhat developed and it covered the waterfront and all it took was one LSD trip. And I saw that. Whoa. Even the most profound texts in my field they don't know about this. It wasn't an hallucination. I knew it. Okay. And et cetera. So I got out in time. I started to see that. Whoa. The people who stay on it even a little longer than me. I could see their memories start to decay. I saw all kinds of and then I heard about yoga and meditation and I heard this is the way to do it. Naturally I got out immediately. I never really wanted to take the drugs but what it produced was very impressive. And so it was beneficial for me. But then in looking back which I did some years ago with other people who did what I did we all did it together. We knew each other. Overall it's been a disaster. In other words it opened a door to all kinds of people using chemical comforters. And there's got to be a chemical for everything no matter what it is get a chemical for it and constantly discovering new ways to get high and people don't know what to do with it. So we have an epidemic of addiction and so forth. So maybe it was beneficial for me. I honestly think it was but I didn't know the full implications of it. And in this teaching before you do something you might want to reflect and you do your best while you're doing it. If you see that oh I thought this was beneficial but as you're living it out you see it really isn't. Cut it off if you were mistaken apologize. But then even after it's over and it seemed beneficial we're encouraged at least sometimes to then look back and review it. If it turns out that it was wrong and you feel some remorse as I did and then feel the remorse it's not a guilt trip and learn from it and move on. So I'm less hasty about certain things that seem us right away to be very helpful. But you have to. I hope so. Maybe. What's your third one? Got hurt in the past. Wounds in the past. You hurt others. Others hurt you. It's a major part of life of course. But wait a minute. I did mention it. I did. I said faith is. In other words it's like a hypothesis. I don't know if I mentioned it last week or now but in the Buddhist teaching look the doubt is encouraged. So you might say well wait a minute that's in conflict with faith. No you need some faith to mobilize the energy to set in motion activities to test what's being told to you. How else are you going to find out? But faith is provisional here for example it's not like you're a person of faith for the rest of your life. I haven't verified a thing but at least I have faith. Now faith can be a powerful path for some people. But this isn't that. It's faith to the possibility that this is something that's beneficial. If you don't have that faith Where's the energy going to come from? Why would you even want to do it in the first place? So it's helpful. It sounds plausible sensible. Your teachers desperation. Sure. Desperation. But your judgment is usually not so good when we're desperate. You have to do the best you can. So typically some degree of conviction is necessary confidence tentatively so that we have the energy. If the person says X Y I'll give you a simple one. Probably all or most of us in this room have done it whether you know it or not. Breath awareness in and of itself. We're not talking about insight meditation but pasta enlightenment. Just simply being able to improve your ability to maintain a continuous attention to the breathing will bring a tremendous amount of joy and peace to you that probably you've never known before. It will also refresh the mind rejuvenate the mind be healthy for the body and sounds good right? Have you found that to be true? I have. That's why I do it. That's why I teach it. If you haven't then the question would be have you done it adequately? So it's been tested. You can't have a hypothesis and then never go to the laboratory. You have a brilliant hypothesis and then you just argue about it with your colleagues in the cafeteria all the time. But you never go into your laboratory and get some results because it might be wrong. And that's the whole point of that Sutra. Okay please. Role of what? Pathology? Yes. If we are trusting our deepest experience our own experience and our experience is clouded or even founded foundation is. Yes. How reliable is my experience? That's what I'm saying. It's the same question. What I'm saying is to begin with it's not very reliable. And that's often why the councilwise is helpful where somebody who for example it's all over the place. It's rampant that we don't have good judgment and we have tremendous confidence in our lack of judgment. And we get into incredibly destructive relationships and we do all kinds of negative things. We're not seen clearly. It's illusory. The path is premised on that that we all start from illusion but we don't think we are. Let's say if you have remember this from the point of view of liberation and wisdom which is the same thing. From a certain perspective a person can be intelligent and have good judgment relatively good judgment. But then as you live you make certain choices and decisions and they're not working. And certain things are happening again and again. And it's what you're saying. The pathology is distorting your ability. I'll give you an example a very earthy one. I hope you won't be offended. Ajin Mahabul who is one of my teachers in Thailand. Westerners would come through. Some of us live there for some time. It's in the jungle way off. And this fellow from California some of my best friends are California. The reason I have to say it is I think you can kind of get a sense this was easily ten years ago but not exactly a hippie but in that vein. So there would be after lunch there'd be a question and answer period. And I forgot the exchange. And this fellow from California described how he makes his decisions which is he said I just follow my heart. I look inside and I follow my heart. And Buddha Dasa Mahabua couldn't get the translation so the translator tried three four five times. Finally he got through what he meant and he just fell over laughing and he said you trust your heart? Follow my heart. That cesspool full of urine and feces sort of like full of delusion and misinformation and prejudice. And that's what's guiding you in life. Okay so here we are. We're all a bunch of confused people. Let's hope we don't confuse each other further. And that's why the Council look sometimes people come to this center who've had a very rough time really rough. They're on the edge and they're in no condition to fully do what this Sutra is saying. Here's a teaching that may be helpful and much more. It's like a parent with a troubled child sometimes more attention. In a sense you are substituting your judgment in a graceful way to help them get to the point where little by little they can step out on their own and make their own see more clearly. I would say it's an ongoing thing because as your mind gets clearer everything changes. But you have to do the best you can. Is that getting it what you're bringing. Back to what you were saying about narcissism? Yes. You see what it is? Yes. But now if you're so narcissistic that you can't allow awareness to see that you are then you're going to be stuck there for a while. Or a whack. In the Zen tradition I use physical. Yeah. Here we whack you with words we're more gentle and then they Wack you with a stick. Okay. Yes. Maybe they're better off since you're not asking questions. I'll talk to myself. In the short run a whack with a stick can be quite more impressive. It can be more impressive but in the long run it doesn't encourage a certain kind of self reliance and sensitivity. Where in the short run it won't be that impressive because we tend to want to enter zones of comfort and dilute ourselves. So I've done both. And they both have strengths and weaknesses. Okay. You got it. And certainly you understand what I'm saying. Yeah. Please. Reflecting. There's an old thing that sort of ties together your comment in the vein of how much of our culture is some ambulance. We're just sleepwalking. All of culture. Not just this one. Exactly. And how lending our ears to the person with wisdom. Cut through it. Someone once told me that the person without intelligence does not learn from their own mistakes. That's right. The smart person learns from their own mistakes and the wise person learns from. The mistakes of others. What do you think you can learn from both. But I would say that in this approach the premium is definitely to learn from your own mistakes. Let me give you a couple of examples and also an answer to the question life can help us out so we're not just so helpless. I'll give you one for my own practice. But first a short one. I don't know if any of you read it in The New Yorker some months ago. A very eminent neurosurgeon. How he decides on he gets enormous numbers of people apply for residency or to work with him and they all have excellent grades come from great schools great recommended. But what he uses is he asks questions like have you made any mistakes in your medical training so far? And if the person says yes then they say what have you done when you've seen a mistake? The ones who say I haven't had any mistakes in their medical in the waste paper because they're finished. Then there are others who say I've made mistakes but they'll say they blame it on someone else. It's never them. And what he found the best ones are very comfortable with what you're saying really because life is teaching us. Let me give you a first. This is the most vivid example I can give to you because sometimes something can be correct but it's not right. My mother was dying and towards the end she was paralyzed. Her brain was fine. Her mind was very clear and she had one arm and the hand about it. Everything else was paralyzed. It didn't work. And the whole family is around her. She wasn't dying in that instance but it was clearly on the way out. And her breathing was so belabored that all the family was there. I could see and including it myself. It was painful to be in the room with her. We all gathered around her bed because each breath was so exhausting for her. And so Mr. Dahmer Mr. Wisdom I'm holding her hand. Yeah. I was holding her hand with my right hand. It's that vivid. And stroking her forehead and I was holding her hand. And I start giving her an A number one beautiful Dharma talk about how your body has served you well in life and now it's time. You don't have to hold on so tight. It's okay. Essentially telling her it's all over. Let it go. She's not a Vipassana meditator. You have to understand that she's a Jewish woman born in Russia then grew up in Brooklyn and she never heard of this stuff. But okay my son does it. It must be okay. That was after ten years of doubting it. But at any rate. So I'm giving her very wonderful teachings on impermanence death awareness. Stop fighting stop struggling. And the better the Dharma talk was the tighter her hand would get to the point where she was. Where did that strength come from? She hated hearing that. She hated it and then at a certain point you see how intricate this process is of self knowing. At a certain point I saw that what I was telling her was on behalf of myself and everyone else. We were really uncomfortable with how hard it was for her to breathe. And my advice to her it was correct but it was not right. And as soon as I switched to I didn't use the word meta which is a training and lovingkindness which we do. I said Mom I stopped with all this. Your body has served you well and now it's running out. She was 90 for goodness sakes. Okay so I dropped all of that straight terravard and Vipassana rap. And I just said You've been a loving person all your life and you've loved many people and many people love you and we love you. And then her hand relaxed and a smile came on her face. I learned life taught me this is wrong that this teaching is not appropriate for this person. It's unskillful. So there is help from it. But again you have to pay attention to your own mind and to what life is teaching you. Please. Exactly. Exactly. I would say that that's the prerequisite for anything worthwhile it all grows out of that attention and the willingness to learn from what you see in here. And then there is help. Forms techniques methods. Even teachers once in awhile can be useful. Not too often but once in a while. I'm kidding. You're supposed to support me in that thing. Okay I'll have to examine that tonight. We have time for a bit more if there's anything else on your mind. If not you can have a refreshment please. Yes. Okay. Let's say you're not really taking care of business in the present. And by business I don't mean just literally business. And you're a dreamer and you keep inventing comforting consoling pleasant realities about some. Look many of us spend a lot of time waiting for an improved future to come. In the meantime we're not really in touch with the actuality of now let's say you're doing a lot of that. Then time is eating you. That's not going to go anywhere. Or sometimes one person asked me well what's wrong with fantasizing this person? It's obvious that fantasy was very important in his life. And we also know what kind of fantasizing right? All right do I have to spell that out? And so he didn't want his fantasies taken away from him. So my job isn't to take anything away from you. It's get you to look at saying Look I don't know you. I remember this one. If you're spending so much time fantasizing sexually that it's keeping you from meeting a real person then you better look at that so that you see what I'm getting at. So that's time eating you you eating time. Also. It has many many meanings. One is we're afraid of death. If you look closely you'll see we're afraid of the idea of death and in that sense that's eating you. I don't want to go further but you have a hint. There one last question or comment or anything. The heat has gotten you down today I think. No I think the talk was so overwhelming. That okay. Thank you very much. Could we just have a moment of silence? All beings be happy. May all beings be peaceful. May all beings be free from suffering. That includes us. All beings. I want to modify the example of my exchange with my mother. That was the right finally that was the right response. In that situation. In another situation the teacher might have cut through that no matter don't hide from the fact that life isn't permanent et cetera. So don't take that to be. It's not a formula. Wisdom is something that is always sensitive to the particular conditions and situation of the moment. It's called Upaya or it's one of the main requirements of good Dharma teaching is that the teaching is good for the person in front of you at that time in place. Then again in a group like this of course it's general. But then if we get to know each other better or in a certain situation sometimes what is textbook wise right isn't my mother is not going to become a Vipassana Yogi in her 90th year when she probably well it turns out she had about a week to live and so that was correct. I think so for her. But someone else who has different aspirations who's much younger and et cetera is misusing meta. Every time there's some difficulty they retreat to something other than looking at their problem. Then good teaching might be to cut that away and help the person see what they're doing. I just want to make sure that we understand that it's not a formula. Okay? There's stuff downstairs. T oh there is something. Okay.

Okay. Please. At the beginning of your talk you referred to me the reference of Socrates. I did. And knowing yourself the. Difference is that. You perceive the way that Socrates went. About knowing himself in the way that one knows himself. The Buddha let's say. I'm not qualified to answer it except in a rather superficial speculation. And I have a good friend who has a PhD in Socratic philosophy teaches here. He's a student who comes here and what we've talked or other ways in. General other ways of knowing oneself as contrasted with the Buddhist way. As far as I only know this one. But the difference that I've seen with Socrates. Why would you want to know a whole bunch of other ways than this one? What's in it for you? I don't know. Look at it. Find out where that question is coming from. Is it just speculative curiosity? Is it going to help you move you ahead move you into this? I don't know. But look let's finish with Socrates. Based on what I've read and spoken to scholars they're talking probably about the same mind but there's not as much help offered by Socrates. For example I'm sure the Buddha is not the only wise person who ever lived but he may be one of the great teachers who ever lived because he offered. It's a very large Department store and there are methods and techniques and forms for virtually anything you want to talk about in Socrates. I didn't see that and that's why the questions were burning inside of me. But I don't think I did a whole lot about it. And when I got to this retreats and meditation and instructions I saw that this could really come alive. It came alive. And so I kind of went back. But I don't know maybe there were methods that I don't know about. But I would say one strength of the Buddhist teaching is that he left for us a legacy of actual things to do to make this a reality rather than just reflect on or talk about that's the best I can do. Sorry. Please. In this day and age as a. Normal human being you're a normal human being?", 'human_start_time': '1:00:43'}, {'talkname': '20080402-Larry_Rosenberg-CIMC-self_knowing_a_quiet_passion_part_34-35552', 'question_num': 'Question 3', 'url': '/talks/35552/20080402-Larry_Rosenberg-CIMC-self_knowing_a_quiet_passion_part_34-35552.mp3', 'display_name': 'Self Knowing: A Quiet Passion Part 34', 'date': '4/2/08 19:00', 'start_time': 3789268, 'content': "Yeah. Okay. What levels of release suffering are possible? What do you mean? Why don't you start with your suffering? Go ahead. Is enlightenment a reasonable goal? Or if not then like what? I know that for instance some of the other teachers here say that there's a lot to be gained from practice progressively. But I'm just wondering to what degree is it really that worth it? Okay here's where one of my teachers I asked a question like that once in Japan and his answer was no. All this sitting in retreats this is totally worthless he said. But if you don't do this worthless thing with the most sincere effort you can your life will be worthless. You figure that one out. But I'll try to be more concrete than that. Yeah but there are different models of how to answer your question but they're just ideas. I think what would be more interesting is what's in back of your question. But I'm going to tell you I'm speaking in general. Now one model is you could call it the stepladder model of practice. That is there's enlightenment whatever that might mean way at the end of the rainbow. And if I do sit enough and walk a lot only eat vegetables and do all this kind of thing then someday don't have too much sex don't eat too much don't do. Then someday everything will be perfect. There'll be just no suffering et cetera. It's a model. Okay. There's another model. Clearly I don't favor that model but it's easier for people to grasp that one because that's like junior high school high school BA master's degree PhD. In other words we like this. You do this and then you get this far and then you move a little further and then at the end of it you get a degree or you get a reward or something so we can handle that. Cause and effect cause and effect and so forth. There's another model which is the practice and realization. I don't like the word enlightenment. I prefer the term awakening. What Buddha literally means is because enlightenment has connotations from European enlightenment. And also people don't know what awakening is. More it's closer. I feel in texture to what you can experience. A Buddha. It's a general term. It's not like a last name like Rosenberg. Buddha is a generic term for somebody who's fully awake. Okay. Now this other model which I favor is practice and awakening are the same thing. It's not means to end because in taking care of this moment meaning you're fully attentive to this moment not only are you taking care of suffering but in this moment you're developing something that is to some degree similar to what the Buddha has. It's not full awakening but you're practicing being awake for 10 seconds. For 2 seconds. It doesn't have the depth the continuity the subtlety the refinement of let's say a Buddha. But let's say you're learning violin. It's not Yahoo D Menuin but you're still scratching out some tunes. But the point is the first one is premised on a future a model in the mind of time. That is if you give me enough time I'll evolve and then I'll become perfect. The second one is all we have is now and that's all we're ever going to have. So to me it's a more mature model personally as you take care of this moment which is all we have for sure. Do you follow me so far? Yeah. Okay. Now have you been practicing for a while or you're fairly new. Kind of two years but not really consistently. Okay. So I would say relatively new. Let's talk about liberation because often that's another way in which this is talked about awakening. Liberation enlightenment. They're often used as synonyms. When we think of liberation someday down the Pike I'll be a liberated person. So we do all these things in order to get liberated. And there are breakthroughs. Things happen as you practice sometimes where huge chunks of suffering fall away never to be seen again. But it comes. When it comes it's not something that's predictable. But in this other model what would be enslavement the opposite of liberation and ignorance which would be that what we typically do is if things are nice we grab onto them and want them to last. We want more of it that typically causes suffering. When things are not what we want we get into a struggle with them. We avoid them. We want to annihilate them or get away or change do anything to escape from it. When it's neither we get bored and we just fill it up with fantasy. When it's neither we want or we don't want. The Buddhist teaching Dharma is neither of those. It's not grabbing onto what we like and it's not pushing away what we don't like. It's being aware of what's happening. So if there's something joyful that's happening to you experience it. It's not saying don't be happy. And then when it's gone it is gone. Now. It's a skill to learn how to fully enjoy what's there while it's there. And wisdom is understanding that of course it's going to go and it's all right. And then we're with what's next. And if next is suffering rather than this all the time it's establishing a very different relationship with what's happening. In the terms that I'm using it might be 5 seconds of liberation or freedom that's all. But this is what makes up the texture of our day. So I prefer that model.

I still sort of see that in. The context of time. My understanding is that however you put in words it's still going to draw. Upon that fundamental misconception. Right. Well which time? You see there's clock time and there's psychological time. Clock time is a practical it's just a convention. We need. It psychological time. The mind makes up. There's no future. It doesn't exist. When we get there it will be the present. There's no past that is over with never to return that's psychological time. We're living in virtual time if you know what I'm trying to say. The practice is coming to live in real time. But in a way you have a point because there's a byproduct of taking care of this moment. So here's a practical aspect of it. If you start becoming aware of things in order to get some future progress you're not fully attending to what's happening because the corner of your mind is goal oriented. If you fully take care of the present moment 100% a byproduct of that is that it moves you along. It's not fatalism or passivity. It has a dynamic force but you're not trying to move yourself along.

To that's your word? I didn't say that. I know but we'll leave it. That's fine. So you'll do more of it. Otherwise you get the rewards and then you want to do more of it. Like Pavlov's Rat. Yes I understand. No but that's what we're already doing isn't it? But it's fine. One of the reasons Buddha was a skillful teacher is he didn't insist on nonattan. From day one he understood these are egomaniacs to begin with all of us. And they get attached to anything and everything. Leave them alone for a while. Let them be attached to feeling. For example here's something I get from people who are very new. They follow the breath and then they have a hard time at first. And then suddenly they'll come into an interview and say oh I finally experienced it. I felt so calm in this last sitting. Oh I guess I'm getting attached now. What I would say is Good please be attached. The day comes when it is when you let go of that coarse attachment. Then you pick up a slightly more refined attachment and finally you let go of all of it. But you can't do it all at once. Do you see what I'm okay I've made it less clear for you. But let me ask you what's in the back of it for you? You don't have to tell me but you should know that's self knowing self knowing is learning to understand yourself. What is this question really about for you? And you don't have to tell me unless it's obvious. Doubt? Yes. Good. So let's say doubt comes up now. Because I do these things. I'm going to say Fine doubt is welcome. But because there are a lot of things that are doubtful in life we're being sold all kinds of things that are not true advertised. Right. Maybe this is one of them. I can't honestly say that when you're enlightened that's the end of suffering. I'm not selling used cars. This is about a life. And knowing what I do know about life just a little bit is that the challenges just keep coming. But what we can do is we are better and better equipped to deal with whatever happens whatever comes our way. And of course perhaps the last deep challenge for all of us or for most of us is dying. But doubt. It's good that you brought that up and that you know it because doubt can be like a tapeworm. Doubt will keep you from investing the energy to find out if this stuff is true. Do you see what I'm getting? Let's say if you doubt yourself here are the doubts typically and it may not apply to you. One is you doubt the teacher. What does he know? He's not from Asia. He's just making a buck. The other is out the teaching. It's too ancient it's from another culture. How could it possibly be relevant in this modern world? But the main doubt is we doubt ourselves and that isn't limited to meditation. Now if you don't take care of that doubt that's sapping your confidence your energy which keeps you from fully applying yourself so that you can find out if this is all a bunch of nonsense or if it's true. So it's important that you take care of that one here. When the doubting mind comes up is just be aware of it hear that mind don't grab onto it don't push it away. Be mindful of it. Does there have to be some understanding of you guys? It could be. You might see what sometimes the understanding comes with it and sometimes that can be reflective pulling over to the side of the road and reflecting but look if you're going to spend all your time the reason this is so because my mommy and Daddy they eat it and they dropped me on my head when I was four years old and then go over that over and over. The main thing is whatever helps you free yourself of the doubt so that you can apply yourself fully to find out if this is true or not. You can't think you weigh through this one. You have to do the practice to find out if this is false advertising or if there's some truth in it.

They come in unpredictable endless numbers. There's no knowing how many there will be. They may be enough to go past the work hour. They may be only 15 minutes worth of washing but one has to begin from the first moment with great care and great speed. One is working with somebody else as well.

There's a whole heartedness this is a transfer I think from what we're doing right here in the hall. Exactly. Or with eating meditation or whatever.

I wasn't meant to myself how often I slept that room how nothing could be around. I was just spotted and I'm not. That way at home. And I realized something that. When I. Have a clear mind it seems like I have it clear my ear that I need the room clear. That's how I made the connection. And I couldn't even stand a piece of clothing on the chair. That bothered me. And so I was really kind of shocked at myself. With a pain in the neck I might become at home now so that's I hope it carries all. I had the job to clean the meditation part. And in the description it said could all the mats nice and square and keep them all back? And at first I felt terribly honest. How could they get the job to somebody who has not meditated and has never been at the center? I mean has not meditated long and has never even been. They felt terribly terribly honest. Oh yes that's nice. And then of course what happened is they know what they're doing that way to give me this honor which made me happy. But also I thought they don't know what they're doing because here comes the German house. Fight. Them up. I started three or four different techniques to do the best training and discovered lots of things about that. And I didn't do a better job. And I always do because when I clean I clean. I do it wholeheartedly. I may not like it but I'll do it. Actually I did like to do it here but it's the same thing. Nothing got anything as it already does. But what I've got to tell you is the German house is a square Max. I was simply overwhelmed by them because how I started it put everything in exact order. And what amazed me how much I enjoyed setting things right. And I thought Here you go again. Because ever since I was a child they told me I'm judgmental. And I discovered this steep seated irrational pleasure which is putting like taking the blankets holding them exactly on the top of the pillow. Something is funny. It didn't need to be that good and to be done. And so I found the child in that kitchen. I thought I had mellowed to a great deal and to a great extent. And people didn't call me judgmental anymore. And I was still wary of being it. And he had arrogant. I set them right in the choir see like when they were gone. And after I discovered that I felt very ashamed and slightly humiliated about this pleasure I had I was all right because I was telling him how to fit. There also was rearranging these and found really that every day I did do a little less of straightening out and a little more of this ordinary cleaning. And I was with every minute. Like then it was almost right. I left it there. I made it hard for myself. And the pillow was not exactly in the middle. I said this is fucking nasty. It's a little interesting story of now. How do we call this? Of judging oneself in a mellow way. In other words finding out about oneself and doing some little learning there in a very practical sense. After I discovered that I hadn't really given up. But I thought I had given up. A few things about work here and everyday life. My job was to prepare salads every day. And I've had a kind of very work career. It seems as always in transitions in my life I find myself back in the kitchens by choice. In part I I mean didn't choose this job. So this wasn't my job. Between two major careers. I wound up baking brick for a year had done that ten years ago. And so it's kind of been like that anyway cutting the vegetables and washing lights and picking out slugs and all of that. I really loved it. Only as I reflect I had a lot of meaning. And I know it just left me feeling very peaceful doing that. And it was an interesting thing because we were assigned that job during the shortest walking period of the day. And so it invariably ran over the choice of it running over into this part of the sitting I felt really comfortable with because I felt attentive so attentive in there that I didn't feel like I was missing anything. And it was really nice today cleaning my room because I'm thinking about leaving tomorrow and using that afternoon bear awareness to do that. Bear attention time. I had an interesting experience. One of the things on my door was to make sure you clean the mirror. And I've been shaving in that mirror all week thinking it was relatively clean and I was cleaning it and it was Lo and behold I was looking back at this face and the mirror was totally different than I've been using all week. And it was kind of a special moment. You kind of really symbolized the part when it taken place. Did you see your pool face? No. But a cleaner rendition. The other thing is that work for me in everyday life has been I can't separate it at all from my spiritual life. I guess it might be partly because the thrust of my training has been to make that occur to be really conscious of that every day how it works itself how I am full by my job and in my job and I just work and job. Call on. Me continuing to pull resources out of myself that I'm not that are kind of late. They have to come to the four very much like the example you gave of the woman in Cambridge. So I found that for the last ten or twelve home used to be just a very special part of my life. One difference I found cutting the vegetables here and at home is that and I used to give great care to it at home as well but less so recently is that my quality of attention in doing it was more refined here. I thought well maybe it's partly because of time but there's more than that as well. I think it's just part of the attention I brought to it as well. There are ways in which work is dealt with for example in one way in which Japanese end monasteries work which will give you a sense that some of this is coming up spontaneously here. One thing they'll do is all the monks rotate so that nobody has the same job all the time. And so some of the jobs are let's say nurturing jobs where you're let's say cooking helping people picking their spirits up if they're down and others where you have to play the tough guy and people are falling asleep in the meditation hall screaming at them or hitting them with a stick and you rotate through it including in some of the jobs are quite menial. In one of the best monasteries that I spent a little bit of time at even the Zen master was part of it. And you'd see a Zen master maybe 60s or 70s cleaning the toilet or you see them working out in the fields. It's totally integrated into the life. It's not superior or inferior. And for most of us that's a foreign idea. We have to overcome a lot of aversion. The lack of fulfillment. And work is something you do. You put your time in and the whole point is to get out of work to get as much free time to do what you really want to do in the kitchen of this particular monastery which is a very traditional approach to cooking. They give a lot of instructions to the people who work in the kitchen to treat the food with the same care as you're preparing the food with the same care that you would treat your eyes. And then it goes into instructions that the meals are quite uneven in these monasteries. That is if there's a lot of donations there might be a lot of good food and if not it'll be very simple meal or a lot of leftovers. And there the challenge is to bring the same quality of attention to the leftovers let's say a really ordinary meal compared to almost a banquet. They're really just ordinary leaves and a few little bit of rice. And it goes on like that. Life itself provides us with enough for those opportunities really. But that's an interesting way to do it. Anyone have any reactions to the job situation finding an appropriate work right livelihood? That aspect of the talk. Was that relevant for anyone here? One thing that you mentioned that was really relevant for me was I reflected on four or five years ago when I first mentioned I was baking bread in a natural food between just finishing a very kind of professional career so to speak and not ready to go on to the next one. And for a while in that job which I've done before in another place well when I first took it I really relished because I had to get up at 03:00 in the morning and I tried to do my sitting before that and then go off to this job because it was baking bread. It was a special thing for me. But then what happened was here I was in this very hustley bustly very popular restaurant in Cambridge right in Harvard Square and I would see a lot of people that were doing the work that I had done. People were therapists people that were educators. And here I was walking around in a white apron and sweating and eating bread all day. And I remember those distinct moments when I would feel very self conscious because here I was in courage doing this menial work in relationship to what they were doing. And that's what was happening inside. And I remember really having to kind of really confront that look at it and work with it and talk to my wife about it and really kind of come back to feeling this isn't what I was doing. And I actually chosen to do it again and feeling good about it. And I can remember the kind of restlessness of that few week period when I didn't even kind of want to go out to the front where everyone was and stayed in the back. So a lot of the problem is perhaps what you thought other people thought of you. Yeah exactly. Like here I was this person with all this education and done all this particular stuff and now he was back in the kitchen eating bread and I had to recycle that whole process. Am I doing this over again? Is this a cop out and blah blah blah blah blah until finally I could bring myself to it again in a good way. So it's very much what you're talking about in terms of rehabilitating oneself right in that job? Anyone else relate to the whole right livelihood issue?

I've been in it for seven or eight years now and one of the things I realized is that even though I consider it ideal very often in past years I've suffered a lot on my job and it's been my own fault brought a lot of negativity and self doubt food work and even with that I felt pretty good about it. But I've been thinking how much more fulfilling it can be if those factors are toned down or minimized. How would you go about doing that? How can you apply what we've been learning here to your work situation? Well simply accepting all the various situations that come up in my work situation Being there with them instead of resisting them. I'm a teacher so I see so many varied situations that I have my favorites and I had my ones that I would ruin my whole week. One class black Tuesday when I see a certain group of people and. I. Realized that is not necessarily black Tuesday. If I can make a suggestion about that it's come from a certain amount of experience that people have had in say work situations which push our buttons. Often people will think that they're being let's say these students come in and they push your button. You're offended or annoyed or whatever it is. People will think that they're being aware of their work situation. What is really happening is after it's over or five minutes later or ten minutes later they're reviewing what's happened to them and they're saying boy I went in there and they did this and I felt terrible et cetera. But what we're trying to develop here Our reflexes have to become very quick. And so as they push your button the awareness has to be right there with it in the moment that it happens. It's not to say that there isn't some value in reflecting on it afterwards. Sometimes that can be useful too. But if we don't develop that ability to meet the response in order there's an objective challenge. They come in and then you have a subjective reaction to it. An awareness has to be there right with it. If it does it doesn't take root. You feel the annoyance or the apprehension and the bottom falls out. I mean test it see it takes practice. It sometimes requires when that time comes you know they're about to come in in five minutes to form the intention to remain alert while they're knowing full well that they're going to push your buttons or have that impact on you. And little by little learning how to be so supple with the application of awareness that we're with what's happening as it happens.", 'human_start_time': '0:56:23'}, {'talkname': '20080521-Larry_Rosenberg-CIMC-king_pasenadi_goes_on_a_diet_part_1_also_self_knowing_a_quiet_passion_35-6513', 'question_num': 'Question 1', 'url': '/talks/6513/20080521-Larry_Rosenberg-CIMC-king_pasenadi_goes_on_a_diet_part_1_also_self_knowing_a_quiet_passion_35-6513.mp3', 'display_name': 'King Pasenadi Goes on a Diet (Part 1) also Self Knowing a Quiet Passion #35', 'date': '5/21/08 19:30', 'start_time': 4075490, 'content': "I've been curious about this for a while and I don't actually read it and sort of scarring again. You don't what? I don't read the books in the library because that's pay attention and try to practice and listen to what people say instead. What people say what said here for example. Oh yes. Yeah. The distinctions that you're making between words like wholesome and words like skillful which makes more sense to me. And one word that is just confusing for me because of being raised in a religious tradition that I rejected that was in Catholicism. I never understand what people mean. Well specifically here I want to know what you mean when you say spirituality. I have no idea. I hate the term. It doesn't mean anything. It means whatever you want. A spirit this and that. Let me put it in terms of maybe more. I think many people who come here in different meditation centers are refugees from some organized religion. Okay. Myself from Orthodox seven years of Orthodox Judaism and 14 generations of rabbis on my father's side. I gave up rebellion a long time ago because that's the same trap. And I don't hate it and I see some value in it. But I'll put it in terms of a question. To me there's a difference between the religious heart I have to use language and organize religion and it was the difference between the essence of what the Buddha Jesus and so forth what they really did taste for the moment assuming that they were genuine. And then what gets done to it as we organize it and build and institutionalize it which has certain benefits too. People need to come together to feel supported in difficult times. But here's my question. Is there anything that's inherently sacred that isn't put together by human beings that would not be. In other words you would have to go beyond Buddhism Catholicism Islam any ism that you want to talk about. You may use that form because people can and do. But at a certain point you go beyond that. I work with a Carmelite nun in Italy for a while. She was behind a cage. She was what is called an enclosed nun for 27 or 30 years. She's still there training seven other nuns and she never read a thing about this kind of stuff. And I talked to her and she knew exactly what I was talking about. And then at a certain point she was talking about something that was just human and universal. And I said Is it okay to tape this? And she said Are you kidding? If the Bishop ever heard what I'm saying I'd be in big trouble. Okay? So I'm not discrediting that. I'm not saying there isn't something truly sacred. But no matter what word I pick spiritual is the problem with spiritual. It just means let's say if you say oh that person is very spiritual they're okay. Well they're nice. He's cute and all but he's not spiritual. I can't go out with him. It can mean whatever you want it to mean. Any words. But what I'm getting at meditation in a sense is a journey to go as deeply as you can. And if there is any reality here whether you call it God or whatever you want to call it then it can be discovered because it's in you. If it isn't then for me it's not of much interest. So practice is to come to that. I use spiritual just because there's a physical then there's a psychological and let's say whatever's beyond the physical and psychological call it whatever you like. I don't know but I agree with you. Does that make any sense? Not really. We're not done here. I'm not done yet. I'll be happy to. It makes sense that I've heard before. That doesn't mean it's untrue. Doesn't mean it's true either. Well I like the last thing you said. I guess it's helpful. The last thing you said. People make the distinction all the time. Even like my father was in Alanon and talked about the difference between institutionalized people always think of this distinction between religion as an institution and something else but I guess it's always what sort. Of confusing. The belief in some kind of supernatural like metaphysical something. But this is not about beliefs. I understand but this is not about beliefs. I don't believe in anything. But I'm not cynical right? But words mean something. I have to use words but I could say the inconceivable or beyond. The beyond. Would that make you happy? The point is this is just words too and the words you're getting from teachers rather than books. Their value is as pointers and perhaps to keep you doing it.

I'm changing all the time. I'm different person than what I was yesterday. Yeah. And that's not just an illusion but changing self. Yes but you understand. But just the way you describe it that means the fact that it keeps changing like that. So there isn't an enduring core. But if you want to use self in the way that you're using it that's fine. Yes it's empty of inherent selfhood which is not to say it doesn't exist. It just doesn't exist in quite the way in which people think it exists. So that would be fine to talk that way. Sure. But it's an inherent changing stuff. Yeah. It is going to become a language problem. And what would help you in my opinion most of all is not to have paint with a big brush on a big canvas but to watch your mind from moment to moment and notice that from moment to moment different images come up different conclusions about who you are what you are memories. In other words find out what are the materials this notion of self it's just a word. After all there's a kind of a current in us a feeling and that there's a solid person on that motion picture screen. But we know that in a deeper sense what there are is a rapid succession of frames that give us the illusion that there is a continuous being that's going on. That's not a bad analogy to what is being said. And as you get to know your mind from moment to moment you'll see that it is forming self descriptions through images and words and kind of just feelings of currents of feeling. All would seem very convincing. That's part of the problem. It seems very convincing that there is a self there. And in my own practice a turning point for me in practice was one time where in sitting for a while I just thought I don't care what the Buddhist said or any of these other teachers Nagajana and Dalai Lama and Pik. Nahana okay. What they say the self is real. It's just solid. I was practically in tears. It just felt like if I know anything I know that I really exist in a solid way. And it was only when I could fully allow myself to fully feel that. Then I started to be able to. Oh it doesn't. Because before that I was just in a sense thinking what was ideologically appropriate. I'm surrounded by Buddhists all the time. I was like oh yeah MCL White comes and it goes. The main test of our understanding of this. See it's not a philosophic principle. That's not what the Buddha was about at all. The main test is if it helps us get more free. And emptiness of self is not a bad thing. What it's saying is that the self is interrelated with everything else. It's part of nature. We're all interrelated the materials that make up what we think of ourselves. They come from the culture from other people from our parents. We use all the materials that are around. There's no something that's autonomous and independent that's doing all of this. But rather. And as you get quiet you can see it there's just an ocean of process. And so as long as you know what you're doing there's nothing wrong with talking about itself that way. Then we understand that there is because it's not random. I mean you have let's say certain patterns of responses that are uniquely you and the same for myself. That's how your friends can recognize you. You look a certain way and you joke a certain way and so forth. No one's denying that. But when you look at it you'll see that it's a more complicated thing that it's all arising and passing away. Arising and passing away and that's all that there is. Okay. Really seeing that is what liberates a person. And that's the letting go of the attachment of particularly that notion which is the most poisonous one. Now you don't have to believe that it's not important but I don't think we can solve it intellectually resolve it intellectually. That wouldn't be too interesting to me personally. These notions are put forward in the spirit of each one of you taking it up to investigate. And in order to do that you have to practice. You can't just read books in the library about what the Buddha said. It won't go very far. Yes. And there are times when you get a deep deep experience of a Naza of the fact that it's not an idea. It's like clearly seeing that what is happening from moment to moment is the endless succession of arising and passing away. And there is no one to who it's happening. And it's very liberating on the way. We can get depressed. What do you mean there's no self? It's just life is worthless. It's meaningless. How it commit suicide. But that's a misunderstanding. The truth is it's a neutral thing. It's just describing the way things are. And it has some very lovely things in it as well. It means that for example supposing it was not true supposing that there was a solid core self we'd be in bad shape. It would be hopeless. We wouldn't even be able to practice. You would just be stuck in just the way you are. I mean I'm a this. I have to go through life as a this. Then why would we even bother going to psychotherapy and meditating? The fact that things are changing like that is also the possibility of freedom. But anyway a balanced understanding of it is. It's not that there's no self. It's that the self doesn't exist in quite the way in which we think it does. And the best way to check it is just to meditate and just see what your mind does. See how it creates self out of things a little bit along the lines of what suggests night is one way to do it. It's a time tested way of doing it. See the five CONDAs in action in you. It won't help you if this talk is just a menu that's all. I hope it points to food that really exists. But the only way you'll find out is you're going to have to really look. No it's all right. The other point I thought of when you're speaking with when you say. There'S. Always going to be pain and so on. But isn't that only in the condition state. The Buddhist said there is an unconditioned. Yes.", 'human_start_time': '0:45:51'}, {'talkname': '19900307-Larry_Rosenberg-UNK-emptying_the_five_khandas_of_torment-1571', 'question_num': 'Question 3', 'url': '/talks/1571/19900307-Larry_Rosenberg-UNK-emptying_the_five_khandas_of_torment-1571.mp3', 'display_name': 'Emptying The Five Khandas Of Torment', 'date': '3/7/90 0:00', 'start_time': 3141330, 'content': "And if you're in the unconditional state.

Greed hatred and delusion are silenced with enough intensity and enough continuity so that you break through and you taste the reality that is unconditioned. And then everything has changed after that. Because even if it just lasts for a short while the coming back everything is looser everything is more tentative. The universe becomes more playful.

The same. So the person that enlightened would they still have those feelings but they wouldn't be caught up in a passion. Okay. It'd be hard for me to represent since I'm not on our Hunt. But what I can do is suggest this. The torment that the Buddha is talking about has to do with let's say someone you love dies. And if it's a natural condition that let's say there's a certain aggrieving response. If that should happen you can't stop that. I mean it's like if you prick me I'm going to bleed. But if you make me and mine out of that or it's like I'm grieving. This was my loved one. This is happening to me et cetera. That whole dynamic goes is very different. Then you have torment and it can last for a very long time. Now it is also so again I don't know this from experience but a number of my teachers have spoken to people. I trust that there are people walking this planet and you'll meet a few of them later on in the summer earlier in the summer whose understanding of the way things are is so deep that even if a very dear and loved person dies there isn't a huge amount of suffering because there's such a total complete understanding of how natural that is. Of course we're all going to die. Is that a shock? It is for us because we don't want to. Now what is it that doesn't want to it's again we're back to me and mine. The fact that if a body is born that it must die is obvious. Everything that arises. Plants and animals and humans fish. Wherever you look we see that that process is ongoing. But the torment comes in because it's the ego that thinks it's the body that is terrified. And it's that which makes a natural process into something that's a really deep problem for us. That's why in some Buddhist teachings they refer to the great death. And the great death is of course the death of the attachment to ego. The whole thrust of our practice in a way is to die to the ego before the physical body dies to attachment. So then when the body dies there's. No one there to die no one there to suffer. Now I don't want to get into too much because it will go beyond. I would like to stay close to our own practice. But you are getting at something that at least you should know is a possibility. The unconditioned that was mentioned that is where everything we're talking about is in the realm of conditioning. That's what we know in life now. The unconditioned Nirvana Nirvana whatever you want to call it. Realization liberation. It's sometimes called the unborn or sometimes called the deathless state. That means that in the deepest sense we were never born and so we will never die. Our body gets born for sure and our body dies. But there's something that is beyond that now. Finally the meditation practice is going in that direction. That's our true home. And the answer to who am I? Is no matter what answer you give none of that's. Right. How could it be right? You're going to point out some attribute some characteristic. Okay let's leave it at that. You're not going to understand it necessarily intellectually. And if you do so what? But at least it's helpful to understand that what we're playing with is a rather deep and profound feel that we've entered into. Now you can go as deeply into it as you like. You may want to just calm down. Fine. The center is open to anyone to come here and use it as you see fit. Use it however you want to. But you should understand that the practice is designed for that. It's designed for that. And any movement along the way towards that is beneficial. So let's assume that most of us are not going to necessarily experience a full and permanent liberation into the death of state. That doesn't mean that what we're doing has no value because every step along the way dramatic relief of suffering and torment dramatic and Western people too. It's not reserved for Asia. If you're a human being you're going to suffer. But if you develop wisdom you can be free of that suffering. Suffering in the sense that we meant to use it tonight. Anything else on your minds about your practice? It's okay. You have to communicate. Can you see what you're doing there? Can you see what you're attached to in that moment? Yeah but there's more. Okay. If it would merely just labeling it. That's right. That's the beginning of it. Because anxiety is not just a little name tag like Orange marmalade that you put on preserves it's anxiety. But then if you could play back what you said look at all what you were trying to do. Weren't you trying to get rid of it? I breathe into it. And weren't you working hard? There's an attachment to have the nice sweet free flowing breath and then suddenly anxiety comes. Is this what you're saying? I'm trying to understand. Okay. And then out of the anxiety produces an alarm goes off and the fire trucks come and the police and we've got to do something about it and it makes it worse or it's not helping it. And then you have a problem so you can get out fast. Yeah but see you caught fire. The building didn't catch fire. So no matter how close you sit to the you could run out you'd still be on fire because your mind is on fire. But let's come back to what you're saying and let's see is there another way to do it? And there is. Do you feel that I understood what you're saying? Yeah. Because I want to make sure that I. What if we have a rerun and now you're back and you're following your breath and it's beautiful. As probably many of us in this room you can become very happy human beings just sitting quietly doing nothing and breathing. Right. Okay. Okay. Now remember that probably you did remember it and you wanted more of it. Suddenly that's interrupted. And then everything that you described happened. Now in the language of our practice what happened was you got attached to pleasant feelings. There was Vedana. The breath felt really nice. And it's not for you to beat up on yourself because it's a natural tendency that when we have positive pleasant Vedana nice feelings then we want more of them. See that's natural and normal. There's nothing aberrant about that at all. And when it's not nice let's say it's painful then we don't want that. We want to usher it out the door or extinguish it in some way or get away ourselves. So what happened was you had the nice feelings and then you wanted it to continue but it didn't at that moment because of that wanting I want this nice breath. But you got anxiety instead or whatever it was that was a departure from what you wanted. Now if you could begin to see that that's very much part of our practice. What people tend to do is they get fixated on getting certain States out of the meditation. Let's say if you didn't have the anxiety let's say the Bell rang a split second before the anxiety came then you would walk out smiling. Right. And saying I had a good sitting. Someone says how was it when you went to CIAC? I love that place. I just had a good sitting. I think I'm going to become a member. I think I'm going to actually become a super lifetime member. We need the money anyway. But let's say the Bell didn't ring. And so then there's the vidna that's painful. And then there's a disappointment because you wanted it to last but it didn't last. And then you bring in your troops and then it just gets worse. And then you come out and your same friend says how was it? I had a rotten sitting. I don't know why I go to that place every time I go there. Yeah you feel good for like ten or 15 seconds. And then what? It goes away. So that means if you follow the dynamic of what's being suggested is we're going after a pleasant experience using the breath now as the medium to deliver that pleasant experience the same way in which we ran after sex money power prestige nice house good clothes you tell me. And so we're going to suffer in the same way too. Well no. How can that be? This is spiritual. I'm practicing zipassana. Yeah. Vipassana torture is what you're practicing. So that if we're practicing with that dynamic the same then of course because the Buddhist saying it's a law now what can you do? So now let's have a rerun of another. One possibility would be you're breathing beautifully and you're really happy. Enjoy it while it's there. Great. It's inspiring. It will make you want to practice more. It's very healing. Okay. And then suddenly you lose it. And let's say you lose it. And there is this disappointment little by little. What you can do is your awareness can then let the disappointment happen. And so what you become aware of is how disappointed you are now. Then you're back on track. Do you see the difference? You're not making yourself out of the disappointment. You're just mindful of the disappointment. And now it can't bite you. It can't burn you. Now if you do this enough what tends to happen is that after a while while the breath is going beautifully you enjoy it. And then after a while you really understand that it doesn't last. It's subject to the law of change. Things change. And so when it ends and this takes practice you're comfortable with the fact that it's over. And what may happen may be you drop into a more restless mode of mind or distracted or whatever that is and you just quite naturally you're with that. Do you see what I'm getting at? Now if you could remember this it's very helpful. The core kind of skill that's so very important for the Pasta NA yogis is to remember to bring attention to the way things are now. The way things are means the way they are sometimes. They're nice long deep smooth beautiful refined breaths which affect the brain and which affect the body. And we're sitting there really happy to be here tears streaming down. That's the way it is. So you become aware of that. And the next moment that process ends and then you're worrying about you haven't paid your bills. And then there's tension and the breaths become quick and rapid and short and choppy and fighting their way through and not enjoyable at all. And the body becomes tense and you're tired and that's the way it is. And then you see it. Let's say if you follow this teaching then the mindfulness goes to that. And after a while you develop this equanimity about being with what's there now that's far more valuable than constantly trying to get good sittings and then feeling disappointed and then getting a bad sitting and then finally getting a good sitting. And that's just like it's a kind of stock market psychology. So get out of the whole game altogether if you can. And you can. It's very simple. Just see the game. I don't mean it's easy. And at a certain point it's very fulfilling even when you lose the beautiful Vedana of the breaths the very nice feelings but somehow the practice rolls on. It's actually maturing in the practice. And you even feel more mature as a person because what it means is that no matter what happens in life it's workable. It's okay. The breath is good. Fine. It's not good. I know it can't be good forever. And that's all right. Do you see what I'm getting at? So that we don't have to get hysterical and then bring in all kinds of extreme measures to correct what's going on? Let me leave you with this is in regard to your question again I just remembered something that maybe will be helpful for all of us. And then let's give the physical body some tea. There was a very great Hindu teacher called Ramadan Maharshi perhaps one of the great Saints and sages of the century. And he died of cancer. And towards the end he had a very serious case of cancer which lasted a while. And his disciples in our terms freaked out. This was in India and started rushing all kinds of doctors there and were just really terrified and hysterical about it. And Ramadan Maharshi kept saying Let it go. It's time for me to die. It's all right. Relax. He was trying to tell his disciples Give it a rest. Let me go. It's time for this body to slip. It's time to slip away. He had no problems but they couldn't listen. And they kept feverishly trying to keep his body alive longer which they succeeded in. But at one point he tried what people were feeling for what they thought was his incredible anguish because of the physical pain that he was in from cancer. And he reassured them. He tried to give him a sense of what it was like for him. He was trying to say Please you're suffering because of you. I'm not suffering the way you think I am. And here's what he uses an image. And maybe this will help all of us approach a certain possibility in life in small ways. Perhaps you've already tasted something like this has been practicing for a while. What he said was if you have a cup of water and let's say you fill it halfway with salt and then you try to drink it you'll have to spit it out because the salt will be so powerfully coloring the taste of the water flavoring the taste of the water. But what if you have a huge VAT of water and you put in that same amount of salt half a cup of salt but now you put it in like just a huge container of water. You can drink the water because that salt is now dispersed through a huge amount of water. You hardly taste it or you taste a little of it. That it's. Drinkable. Now what he's trying to say is that in the letting go of the attachment to me and mine you live in just more vast space. Literally the world you live in is not the world that we're living in. It's a much more spacious world. And so when any of these things happen it's not saying that the body isn't going through the law of cancer and everything that's entailed. But if the person is not attached and if you're not attached any time perhaps you've experienced this. Even if it lasts for a few seconds when there's no attachment there is more spaciousness in the mind. Okay so we're just getting a little bit of a taste. Now multiply that perhaps who knows? I don't know what number to use. 10 trillion where the mind is infinite where the mind is the universe. Because it's let go of being this that and the other. It's not anyone or anything. And it's not trying to get anywhere. It just is that's of course the happiest state. Now the ego is running around trying to make the ego happy. It's trying to get this and become that. And probably if you're here to some degree it must be because you know that really doesn't work too well. We've all put in our time in the ego mill. And I'm not saying don't get degrees or see because that's not where the suffering is. And I'm not saying give you all your total bank account away. But what I am saying is become a poor man in the sense in which Jesus meant it inwardly. And that means removing attachment of me and mine from the five CONDAs. Now that may sound like well that doesn't sound very romantic or spiritual or mystical but you have to understand parabolic. And Buddhism has a very unassuming plain way of talking about things. Other traditions are more poetic and vivid. And there's some of that in Sarah and Buddhism but some it's just very modest not assuming it's part of what I love about it. But sometimes I wish it would be more expressive because then you'd get it. We'd all be able to get these evocative images. But what they're saying is there's no more torment. It's a negative way of saying that you're completely free and happy all the time period. Why don't we get some tea? It will be a little bit of happiness anyway. It's the best we can do here's. The rest of this is up to each one of us.", 'human_start_time': '0:53:27'}, {'talkname': '20060510-Larry_Rosenberg-CIMC-self_knowing_a_quiet_passion_part_27-2252', 'question_num': 'Question 1', 'url': '/talks/2252/20060510-Larry_Rosenberg-CIMC-self_knowing_a_quiet_passion_part_27-2252.mp3', 'display_name': 'Self Knowing: A Quiet Passion - part 27', 'date': '5/10/06 0:00', 'start_time': 3027590, 'content': "It seems like the goal. Well it just seems like wandering around begging. I know this is crazy. No just saying. It'S like he left this life and then he became the Buddha. And that was better than the previous thing. Yes but from my point of view wandering around and getting kind of bowl of rice every day as opposed to living in a palace. The other thing was better okay? That implies you really know what his life was. In other words see you are focusing on the appearance and on yes obviously. First of all in India at the time spirituality and a lot of traditions was defined by becoming a Monk or a nun basically a Monk and giving up things. That's one I would call it a strategy. The whole point of the Buddhist teaching because the lay people were in on it too is to free yourself of suffering. The rest are all these different forms one of which is to cut down your needs dramatically. Okay. But you don't really know. You see here's the part that you can imagine you know. But I'm going to pull a little rank on you. I hope you'll excuse me. It's not that I'm a big Buddha but there's a happiness that is possible by doing what the Buddha is doing that is incomparably beyond whatever it is your imagination is about. What living in a palace would be because there are headaches there too. Okay? Now how can you know that until you've tasted it you can't. So for some reason maybe you're not suffering enough yet. So maybe life has to punch you around a little bit more. Come back in a few years we'll still be saying the same old thing. I will if I'm here. The old man who kept saying what did he say? Old Larry he just kept saying the same old thing. What I'm saying is you can't really in all fairness judge the quality of his inner life. All you can do is see that he's walking around eating one meal a day and not having sex. And only one. His outfits are three robes. And is that a guarantee of a great life? I've lived in monasteries in Asia. Definitely not. There's lots of suffering there too. That's a value insofar as it helps a human being attain liberation and freedom from suffering. That's what it's about. It's not about one bowl of rice. I have three meals a day. What I'm trying to say is I've had a glimpse of what the Buddha is talking about. Or I'd be a fool to talk the way I do. Just a completed idiot. So whatever small little tongue taste I've had of it you can't take it away from me. The palace another neighboring tribe can come in and defeat you and then you're dead or you're made a slave. What I have here you can't take away from me. If you throw me in prison I have it. If I lose all my I lose my house. It's burning in there. What little I know of it. And the practice just takes me more and more into that. You have it too. That's the real treasure. That's who you really are. That's what the whole practice is about. Now what you're doing is imagining the old mind. But something got you to March over here right? I'm interested in that. What got you to come to this funny room tonight? If you want to be in the palace you don't need to come to places like this. Just work harder and get a promotion and buy a nice big house. Maybe you already have one. You don't have to know there is one mind in you that got you to come over here. I'm interested in that mind. Okay? I was outwardly successful as an academic and inwardly not. In other words the gap between my resume and the quality of my inner life was like Grand Canyon. So if you judged me if you didn't know me and say Whoa he's teaching at a prestigious University. He's healthy he's young he's got money. For the first time in his life he's living in a nice place in Cambridge. Wow. So how come my resume was terrific but it didn't necessarily carry over into the quality of my life. Moreover it wasn't just me that was very painful to see that. That doesn't necessarily. I'm not against let's say University life or success in anything. It's just that what we do in the course of trying to get happiness we all want happiness. That seems to be what it's about is we define it as getting outer things and it seems to be very hard to get that like a relationship. We want the perfect partner. There is no such thing because everyone's imperfect. They're just human and they want a perfect partner. Maturity is starting to for us imperfect beings to be able to learn how to live with each other with some kindness some compassion understanding our limitations and not making them into problems necessarily. What it got me to do after getting very depressed because I worked so hard to get an advanced degree and teach at a prestigious University and get success in terms of writing and all that and have my parents immigrants working class immigrants so proud of me how could you be suffering then? But I was. That was just a fact. Now why did the Buddha leave? Is he just self destructive? Maybe he needs therapy because he had it all made. He was born into everything and he saw that first of all that you have to age that you also eventually you grow ill and eventually you die. And he saw that he wasn't exempt from that and he didn't understand it. Fine. Keep up your thing about wanting to be in the palace. I don't want to take that away from you. But if you're suffering would you rather not be suffering? Okay so there are concrete definite methods here to help you start to do that. So I don't care what you think of where you'd like to be or your self image or all that but if you're willing to learn how to meditate then let's see what happens. But it can help you at least not suffer so much. Yeah please.", 'human_start_time': '0:50:27'}, {'talkname': '20060510-Larry_Rosenberg-CIMC-self_knowing_a_quiet_passion_part_27-2252', 'question_num': 'Question 2', 'url': '/talks/2252/20060510-Larry_Rosenberg-CIMC-self_knowing_a_quiet_passion_part_27-2252.mp3', 'display_name': 'Self Knowing: A Quiet Passion - part 27', 'date': '5/10/06 0:00', 'start_time': 3445940, 'content': "Self known? Yes. And. Experience as being an important to begin with? Certainly yes. Experience of course encompasses a very wide spectrum some of which is truth and some of which is false. How can one approach this wide spectrum of experience with confidence as to what is true and what is not true? Okay remember from this point of view that I'm speaking this is how I would answer that someone else might answer very differently. If something is true then it can help you get free. Because the reason we're suffering unnecessarily is that we're not living in truth. We're living in delusion in our imagination. Okay so learning how to live has everything to do with what you're asking. As your awareness gets more refined you start watching how you actually live. Actually capital letters neon shouted actually not how you think you live or how your mommy told you to live or how your priest Rabbi whatever tells you Mullah whatever religion tells you how to live. And how do you find that out? By paying attention from moment to moment. How do I actually live? You start to get to know how do I eat? What do I do when suffering visits me? How do I handle that? That's what self knowing is. But one of the tests it comes out of an exchange between the Buddha and his 17 year old. We can leave the history out. If something is skillful that means it is beneficial for you and for others so that it doesn't cause suffering for you and for others. If it's unskillful it does so that the training is more and more to be able to recognize clearly actions that are based let's say on untruth and don't work. They're designed to bring you happiness and they don't. And you begin to see of course they don't because they're ill conceived. They're just ideas that don't have enough connection to the way reality really is. It's an ongoing learning because the ability to answer your question I would say improves as you're that's part of the fruit of practice. The clear seeing enables you to be a better judge of how to live. First when you start seeing a lot of what we're doing as I mentioned I hope. Yeah I did mention it is we're learning how to unlearn what doesn't work. And when you start unlearning ways of behaving of speaking of thinking about things and you start seeing how they produce suffering then wisdom is starting to unlearn as any sane person would want to do. Why would you want to perpetuate something that doesn't work? So your ability to do that is pretty crude to begin with. Nothing personal all of us. And as practice gets refined your ability to see where you're off reflexes quicker. And also your ability to act on behalf of what you understand. See we know exactly what to do and what not to do but we betray ourselves often. Okay. That becomes something you examine you begin to see. I see very clearly what needs to be done but I don't want to do it and you don't do it. And so then it keeps being a problem. So then let's say in this practice you would investigate that. That's interesting. There's something that you see very clearly is destructive. Unskillful produces suffering and yet you keep doing it. It could have to do with eating. It could be an addiction it could be this it could be that. So then that becomes the focus of meditation. You start to get to know that. What is that all about? Sometimes we see it's fear. Well if I really tell this person what I think I'll get fired. Do you see what I'm getting at? So it's not a fix but now truth that's a word that's interesting because I would say what I'm talking about now is relatively true. It's called a conventional reality. Where the practice is going is beyond Buddhism and it's beyond anyism it's beyond all the religions. And if they don't all come to the same thing. Look if you read the different religions they all have different destinations. This one you wind up at the side of God. That one. There are many lifetimes. This one there's only this. It seems like the human mind is quite fertile in being able to make up stories about what happens to us after death why we are the way we are and they each maintain that they have the truth and we're more than willing to kill each other over these ideas. Okay. Take a look at a book called The End of Faith by Sam. Anyone? Sam? Yes. Okay. It's extreme. It's very harsh and punishing but there's a lot of truth in it. And we humans are able to live where the evidence comes back again and again and again. A life of awareness is to begin to face that and try to understand well why do we do that? One of the things that we do for example I hope I'm answering question a little bit is let's say there's something that we know we shouldn't do but it feels so good. Let's say it has to do with health. So what the mind does this is what delusion is about. Delusion gives you what you want what the mind will overestimate the gratification of doing this. This is going to taste so great and it underestimates the consequences of doing it. You're going to get cancer or you have cancer and it's going to just be making it worse. So the mind says oh go eat it. It's going to be fantastic. And it also says yeah there's a price to be paid. It isn't that big a deal. And we believe it now. Self knowing as you see that. You see the mind talking to itself selling itself a bill of goods. This practice is like raising a child. Only the child is your own mind. My mind is about four years old after 30 years of practice. I think it's about five now and I'm trying to bring it along. Help it understand itself. Help it. See you see now little Larry there this doesn't work when you do this. Okay? But I want to do it anyway. But then there's a truth that is non conceptual and that's what I'm trying to get out. There's a truth that has nothing to do with any ideology or culture or point of view or Buddhism Christianity Islam inner meaning outer meaning Tibetan Buddhism that's all man made human. And the practice by dealing with the relative truths of our daily life as we find it that can help take us to that which is beyond constructed truth what I would call real truth. Does that make any sense? Do you really think so? Okay. What's your name? Do you have an email? Okay go ahead.", 'human_start_time': '0:57:25'}, {'talkname': '20060510-Larry_Rosenberg-CIMC-self_knowing_a_quiet_passion_part_27-2252', 'question_num': 'Question 3', 'url': '/talks/2252/20060510-Larry_Rosenberg-CIMC-self_knowing_a_quiet_passion_part_27-2252.mp3', 'display_name': 'Self Knowing: A Quiet Passion - part 27', 'date': '5/10/06 0:00', 'start_time': 3917090, 'content': "I have two related questions for someone who has been practicing for some period of time. Okay. How does one judge one's progress and how does one determine what would be the most fruitful practices and areas of inquiry for further practice? It's like how does one judge one's direction? No I understand. I get that question in slightly different many times. It's a very basic and good question. The question itself has to be looked at because some people have minds that are never satisfied in the wrong way. I never got it right. I don't understand. I'm not getting anywhere. There was an exchange not here at a different meditation place just last week that I was doing something like this and the person starts asking me to tell them not the way you're doing it is the kind of inquiry it's more she's telling me please I don't know. I don't know anything. Tell me. She'd been practicing for. I think she said something between 15 and 18 years. Okay. So at a certain point I said look you've been practicing for many years. You've been using this practice. Are you suffering less? Oh yeah. Has it changed your life in any way? Oh my God. I can't begin to tell you how much has changed my life. Okay so there's always that element. Here's another one. I don't do this in interviews but I had Burmese teachers who used to do this let's say following the breath you come in they'll say how many times did your mind leave the breath in that last 45 minutes sitting? This actually happened because I was trained a little bit that way. And then I started off teaching doing it and I stopped it pretty quickly. So the person comes in and says during this past sitting my mind wandered from the breath ten times. The practice is so difficult and it's just going terribly. Then later on someone else comes in. How many times did your mind leave the breath? Ten times. Isn't it fantastic? It's just great. I'm having such a good retreat. Well wait a minute. So I thought that's kind of a crude way of getting people. It's like the grading system again we're back stuck in that. So yet your question is a good one because if you're going in the wrong direction then you can be sincere and put in lots of effort. If you want to go to the North Pole you have to aim towards the North Pole not the South Pole and all the exertion and energy is going to come to north. So the question is what do you want? The Buddha makes it kind of simple though not easy. He's saying all I'm teaching is suffering and the end of suffering. And it's not down the pike. In given moments when you're suffering we're learning how to relate to that suffering to take care of it in a new way. So I would say this in terms of all the different practices. That takes time till you find for example there's no practice for everyone. There really isn't. Breath awareness has been very helpful for me so I use it a lot. But finally I get typecast as Mr. Breath. It's not true. It's just a technique. It's a good technique. For some people. It was good for me. Mostly what I do is I don't watch the breath. I watch my mind and my body now and then I'll draw upon it. And for other people they need a different technique. And you find out by it's. Sort of. You do have to shop a bit. Sometimes it sounds like there's kind of. An experimentation period where you learn what works for you. Exactly. Also it changes over time. What I'm doing now I couldn't have done when I first started. And Unfortunately I had someone who gave me good help and then that kind of wore itself out. It's just like I don't need my cowboy outfit anymore. Okay so that part I would say any practice that helps you develop wakefulness is good. All that Buddha means is it's one who's awake. So that any practice you name it. If it helps you become a little bit more awake then I would say that sounds good to me and then see if that wakefulness is helping the quality of your life. To me the proof of the pudding is in the eating. The Buddha expected you to test these teachings not take it as a new belief. Oh I'm a Buddhist. There is no such thing as yourself. And you feel good and you have a nice community and you're connected with the same old baloney. Is it true? And the Buddha would really appreciate people who doubted his teachings and were willing to try it to find out and to prove it in their own life. And I hope we do that here. I know we try. Yeah please. Yeah. But it's not either or. But again it's different. Some people reading a lot helps them. Some people don't need to read very much. You don't need to know a lot. You need to know the basics and then do it. The main book to read is this book. Exactly. Yeah. So do it. Don't worry about it. Yeah don't worry about it. Okay good. But here's what tends to happen. We make our way we start judging people. Okay. I was a big reader addicted. I would use that word. My first teacher. There's no God in Buddhism. So I was going to say God bless them. But it's also. No not God. It's just non theistic. It doesn't say there isn't a God or there is. That's not what it's not dealt with that way. Okay. He was a Korean Zen master and some of you have heard this. And we were on a plane flying over I was going to practice in Korea for a year at different monasteries and Japan. And we were on the plane sitting next to you on our way to Tokyo. And I pull out my little carry on bag and I have all these juicy Dharma books and he looks at me and says what's that? I said oh look at this. This one. I'm going to be reading this. The Buddha. No he says your problem is you merely know everything already this way kind of knowing. He said no reading for one year. Now. Can you just hear this? I don't know if you've met people like this New York Jewish intellectuals that's like telling someone to go cold Turkey who shoots up. And I went through those kinds of not exactly shaking but incredible misery. But I did do it. And after a while it led to just it was wonderful. I'm one of the best teachers I had over there. This is for your someone else might need to read a little bit to get some direction. One of the best teachers I had over there was illiterate and he thought the world was flat and everyone wanted to work with him. He was radiant. And by our standards he was an ignorant man because he had no knowledge very little and he couldn't even sign his name. From a point of view of wisdom he was not ignorant at all. And somebody could have three PhDs and from this point of view be ignorant of themselves. And that would be a different kind of ignorance I would put it.", 'human_start_time': '1:05:17'}, {'talkname': '20060510-Larry_Rosenberg-CIMC-self_knowing_a_quiet_passion_part_27-2252', 'question_num': 'Question 4', 'url': '/talks/2252/20060510-Larry_Rosenberg-CIMC-self_knowing_a_quiet_passion_part_27-2252.mp3', 'display_name': 'Self Knowing: A Quiet Passion - part 27', 'date': '5/10/06 0:00', 'start_time': 4390030, 'content': "I have a question about just like this in regards to personal relationships of course I feel like when you're especially when you know someone well your conversation is sort of based in an acknowledged play of ego or whatever like you're joking they're like testing things out with each other. Of course it's very dynamic. And I'm wondering I oftentimes when you're trying to find that piece within relationships where you can be real like finding a way to remove it's. Not like a separation or a condescension to be in it and all. See if I understand. If I don't come back I'm going to generalize your question because it's about all of us. Isn't relationship a large part of life? People they're not going to go away. Here we are and this is where we fall down. We don't know how to live with each other. That's the tragedy of we know how to fly. We know how to go under the ocean. We don't know how to live on the Earth at all with each other. Sad. Okay. So at least they've always been individuals who do. They've learned it. They've learned it by doing something like this. Not necessarily this exact practice. Relationship can be a mirror. When you use relationship as a mirror it becomes in quotes a spiritual practice can become. I don't like the word spiritual but I have to something that goes beyond psychological. So let's say you're with another person. We have reactions to each other. And if you start practicing awareness starts to become more and more natural. And it's not just about external but it's more and more you're in touch with yourself. Even while you're in the midst of social life. You don't lose touch with yourself. So you're with let's say another person and they say or do something and it brings something up in you. Now what I heard in your question is an ideal of being a loving person who's at peace inside. Okay. You can have that as an ideal and then try to always be a loving person who's at peace inside. But I think that will be very limited if you don't take care of the fact that you're not at peace. Are you fully at peace inside? That's why you're here right? Because you're not. Okay. Let me act that out. Now I'm with you and you say something like he said. It was a very good talk. Thank you. But I was embarrassed to even be up here. I've heard Dharma talks. This is disgraceful. And I'm sending a note to the Buddha to the Pope. And I feel like it was a very good talk. What do you mean? I can then try to be right or I can then annihilate you try to and then you can kind of shrink or hit me back and then everyone will get them. But if you're practicing what I would feel is I would feel my defensiveness. I would feel like the hurt. I would feel that there's still someone in here who can be hurt by not being complimented. Like I like what you had to say. Yes. He's a very beautiful person. You I'm not so sure about. Okay so the real peace comes from beginning to make peace with the absence of peace. So that this mindfulness would be in touch with how perturbed you are how upset you are and of course in small ways that's happening. That's me. That's ego got hurt. As your ability to improve to do that improves that starts to wither away and then it's replaced by something a different degree of peace. The more mature it becomes the more peace there is. And then what comes out of that? See if you would answer from that. It's a reaction. It's mechanical. You can't help it and I can't help it. But if you don't act it out or repress it see what choice do we have? One is I scream at you and the other is I want to protect my image as a mature Dharma teacher. And you say this is the worst talk you've ever heard. I'm saying like oh you really do. Well everyone's entitled to their opinion. And the Buddhist said Tell me more abuse me more. It doesn't matter because I'm a very wise and mature person. I've been practicing for and that would be denial. Okay? This is neither denial or acting out. Where I hit you or I do a pretense. What it is is I feel the hurt but I haven't lost touch with you. Now if it's an intimate relationship sometimes you can share these things with the other person but little by little you take the power out of that and it's replaced by a different state of consciousness which as that starts to ripen is a kind of inner peace. When I said that the silence is not a good word for it. Love is I would say finally this form of practice of meditation and any real form of meditation authentic. It's not just some stress reduction although if you define stress reduction a certain way that's profound too it's an explosion of love because all the love you could ever want is in your heart. It's already there even if you didn't have a nice mommy and Daddy. But for many people the outer conditions are so damaged that it's like a jungle between they don't have access to this meditation is seeing through all those obstacles that obscure our original nature. It's sometimes called that Buddha nature original nature true nature. There are many names for it. When that Indian master said when he was asked who are you? He says I have no idea what he meant. He knows he's not an idea. That's just a word or picture. He's being just pure being. And then from that. Now let's not make it all or nothing. Any relationship has an ongoing history. And if both people have enough love of each other to begin with they can grow together and they can really help each other grow. But they're going to have to see through certain fixations that they have of how they've treated let's say men and women all their life. And that just gets repeated in this relationship. And so it allows for some fresh ground to be broken.

So no matter what that suffering is that one might be much more refined and subtle and also deep not as accessible as obvious suffering when you're greedy and you don't get what you want. But practice is practicing with what's there. If I can put this in another context one of the problems for us humans all of us is that selfdeception is alive and well. We are very able to fool ourselves and we don't know we're fooling ourselves because otherwise we wouldn't be self deception. We think we're being honest. Many adults if you stop someone do you know yourself? Say someone. They're 50 something like that. Oh yeah. I've been around the block. And they do in a certain sense. Are you still suffering? Come on. Of course I am. Okay so there's knowing yourself and there's knowing yourself. The self knowing has a depth to it. It's an interior journey. And what I'm saying is like Hokusai. I love that journey now meditation. And it's not all fun and games because what you see is Adolf Hitler in there sometimes and you see Mother Teresa too and you see neither of them whatever is there and images you have of yourself get shattered and fall to pieces. So until you start really valuing getting free then no matter what it is you ask me that's between you and freedom. But if you develop the ability to open to it and to receive it and let it be what it is don't try to fix it. That's what we're learning. The art of pure seeing. Pure seeing has no goal other than the seeing. That's why it's often like into a mirror. Let's say there's some pain. It's not seeing in order to not feel the loneliness. If you have a little business deal like that. All right I'll watch this loneliness but it better go away. Why do I say that in a New York accent? I don't know. Something was going in the wrong direction. I was trying to do something with something that was just the wrong approach. Wrong in what way? Wrong in that I was discounting something that was important. Okay. Who makes important and unimportant? You see in the world of clear seeing everything is just what it is. Yes but it's something that comes up again and again and get checked and checked. And that's thinking thinking. But every time it comes up it's fresh because it's happening now. The rest is memories of it. That's how you know it comes up again and again because you can remember oh we've seen this one before but it's not exactly the same one. It's in that family. I understand what you're saying but the art of pure observation has no thinking in it. It's not like oh I've seen this before. Now to begin with your mind will do that. It's going to have a story about and he'll have a name for it and he'll even want is this envy or is this resentment? I don't fully help me understand that. First of all it's not supposed to be a mother. Okay. Yes. Oh I wouldn't want to trivialize that. You'll never find me saying that. No. Okay. See it's better if you make it concrete. Thank you. Okay. Let's say you yearn to be a mom and so far it's not happened. And there's a yearning and we can go into well it's natural biological urge. That's how the human race stays or whatever. Okay. Whatever more or less let the biologists and philosophers argue it out. There it is. And there's some suffering in regard. Right. Okay. No one's saying you shouldn't feel that way. What I'm saying is can you be sensitive to the feelings that you have? It's not telling you that you're supposed to have any particular way. It's saying that whatever way you are in a given moment the art that we're learning is how to be aware of it as it is without judging it without trying to. Okay so that what you'd feel. Is there's a yearning to have a child because as of now you don't have one and it's held onto ferociously and there's a lot of suffering there. Now as you look at that does that help you get a child? No. You see what I'm getting at so little by little? I'm not saying that you shouldn't feel that attachment. You're a very bad Yogi. But what can happen is you can take a lot of the steam out of it. And for example people often ask well let's say couples living together and they love each other. How can there not be attachment personally if you feel you love someone whether it's a parent or a child or a partner? I haven't met anyone yet where there isn't detachment. Okay so you see a lot of the teachings come from monastics. We were back to the people with those folks at the bowls. Maybe you're right. Let's just stay in the palace. What are we running around looking for trouble? We had a good life in the palace there. Okay get me back to reality. Yes exactly. But let's stay with this. You find love between two people who live together and love each other. I haven't met anyone who doesn't have attachment. Then you come and you learn this thing and then you feel guilty like I have attachment. Okay now there's a difference between love and clinging. You can't then decide Well I'm not going to cling. I'm just going to have the love part. It won't work. You're going to get into a struggle with it. But what you can do is feel that extra holding. And as you begin to understand it some of it gets weaker. You also begin to see that it's not exactly the best way to love. Often if a parent loves a child a certain way they're holding onto them too much. Their judgment is impaired. They're worrying. Do you see what I'm getting at? Forget about perfection. You start to understand and you can see there really is a difference between real love is a very powerful force. I'm not talking about sentimental love like I love you Boobie. If you leave me it's all over. I don't mean that real love is as strong as death. It's a real energy in the universe. And there are people who have it who really know how to love. Okay? Period. The practice gets you in contact with some of that. But it can be all mushed up with clinging and attachment not wanting to be left alone and abandonment and all that. But you can practice with that in a gentle affectionate way and not with the goal of never being attached but by learning. The emphasis here is on learning. And you begin to see that the earning to have a child is probably intelligent and good because it'll help you do the things that you will I hope have a child. But then do you have to suffer so much? Maybe not. Do you see what I'm getting at? And so the practice by being with it you'll be able to see the difference between a yearning to be a mom and then seeing that there's some extra suffering that doesn't necessarily help produce a child. And it compromises the quality of your daily life in this moment. And it might even make you less able to when you have a child because that quality is perhaps poisoning you a little bit. Do you see what I'm getting at? So don't set it up as all or nothing and start where you are always. And where you are is you have a strong yearning. It's not bad. And maybe there's some things accompanying it that when you see them they start to lose some of their power. And then it lightens up a bit and you still want to have a child and you do what it takes to have a child. Does that make sense? Okay could we have a few moments of silence? Let's not be too hard on ourselves. We're just human and that's where we start. And then see if awareness can improve the quality of our life as we come to understand what it means to be human as we live out our life.", 'human_start_time': '1:20:04'}, {'talkname': '20061122-Larry_Rosenberg-CIMC-self_knowing_a_quiet_passion_part_29-35547', 'question_num': 'Question 1', 'url': '/talks/35547/20061122-Larry_Rosenberg-CIMC-self_knowing_a_quiet_passion_part_29-35547.mp3', 'display_name': 'Self Knowing: A Quiet Passion Part 29', 'date': '11/22/06 19:00', 'start_time': 3332490, 'content': "I learned how to meditate through a yoga tradition and I learned about spirituality which is very similar to what we're doing here. And I'm trying to figure out where one ends and where one begins because there's a lot of people who can you explain to me? Yes I was in yoga for five years in Vidanta and I did lots of Hatha yoga. Still do it every day. Frankly all those walls are artificial to me but there is a difference. It's a big question you're asking. It's an important one. Maybe this will help you. Some years ago do you know who Stephen Cope is? Steven invited myself and someone else. I forgot who another Buddhist teacher I think Ed Brown from San Francisco. Zen. We had what was called East Meets East at Kopolo and it was a retreat. I think it was a week. So what do they need? Me? It's a yoga center. And what they found was that the people who came were very famous Hatha yoga teachers Kropalo yoga Ayanga yoga et cetera. They are very open to that. And they had all concluded what we call meditation. And this is what I experienced. And I know there's much more to it is let's say there'd be a talk or you do yoga and then let's meditate the last five minutes of whether it was a talk or Hatha yoga set and then everyone would sit and have a Holy look on their face and then the Bell would ring and you'd leave. And I always knew there's got to be more to that. Meditation is more than that. So the reason they were asking us is the Buddhists have really done a lot with certain kinds of meditation. But I also go the other way. I think you kind of said it. The body has been very neglected in Buddhism in a certain way. There's this fear that you're going to get attached and then you'll suffer. I think if we took the strength of both do you have postures that you do and breathing and so forth? Keep it up. It's wonderful. And do you come to this center and you know what mindfulness is and you do it? First of all Patanjali got a lot of it from Buddha. He came later than the Buddha. They've all influenced each other. The Buddha didn't make up mindfulness of breathing that existed thousands of years before the Buddha. What the Buddha did that's unusual or unique? Everyone has known that everything's impermanent everyone in every culture. How could you miss that one? What the Buddha did is he said Turn first of all refine the mind. So it's very steady and clear. And then take a look and see the law of impermanence at work in you. It's not enough to say whole civilizations come and go. The mountains were here and now they're gone. This was saying Take a look at you and you'll see the law of impermanence. No mood stays forever. No thought stays forever. No ideas as to who you are remains the condition of the body and constant flux. So he turned a very familiar teaching equipping the person and to look at that and as a result to help you let go of all that. And I do feel that there's only one place to go when you go deep. How could there be many kinds of freedom really? But I don't feel that all religions go to the same place. To me that's like a bromide to make everyone feel calm us all down. I don't think so. I don't really know because this is what I know. But I would say the Buddhists neglect the body and that's changing now. All kinds of people used to make fun of me because I did all this yoga and had a good diet. My friends Joseph Goldstein Jack Cornfield all these people they're now doing yoga because as you get older you start finding the body starting to get decrepit and fall apart. And people who've been very much into the bodily expression remember potentially yoga has a lot that is quite similar to this. But it wasn't being done in the United States. That part was thrown away and it was all just the body for the body to have I don't know to live forever to be beautiful to have nice ABS whatever. Leotard yoga. I'm not saying you're doing that. Okay. My anchor is in the original teachings of the Buddha. I'm not eclectic but I didn't throw away what I learned in my yoga days from a wonderful Swami Sariswati. No time to go into that. And I've given it a Buddhist twist though. I don't use the chakras and the Nadis yogic physiology. What I use is mindfulness. It's sort of when I do an Asana it's no different than walking meditation. Am I awake as I'm doing it fully? Do you see what I'm getting at? So for me it's not a problem. But I don't know if that's helpful for you. I'm not saying one is superior to the other because I think I've met one. People have gone very deeply in both. This is just what I know. Yeah. Please. I'm. Neither am I. Yes but let me hear. I have to about. I don't know seven or eight years ago. It was a Wednesday night much more crowded before Thanksgiving. This is not a big crowd because people are flying to be with their families and so forth. This was packed. It wasn't Thanksgiving. And at the end of it the talk was over. And someone raises their hand just about this time and they asked me Are you a Buddhist? Which is kind of a strange question you would think. And people tell me because I don't remember. I got silent for more than five minutes and I said no. And half the group got depressed because they want a new thing to identify with and to belong to. And the other group said thank God not another religion. We just want to do this. This is great stuff but don't make me go through what I ex Catholics ex Jews ex something. But I would put it this way now because for me Buddhism is not an affiliation. It's a guide to living. Now if that makes me. If you want to call me a Buddhist that's fine with me. I don't care about the label. I don't know the holidays. I don't know what all the different gestures mean what the ceremonies are. Not only that please don't take this as disrespectful. I could care less. I just don't care about that now. I don't want to voice that. Some people do. And it can be a wonderful religion for people. I've seen it all over the world. I'm not against that. I tried to be that way. It just doesn't take. I'm just hopeless in that way. I don't like ceremonies. I don't like ritual. I did years of it bowing 101 times full prostrations every morning for five years chanting in Chinese and Korean 45 minutes in the morning 45 minutes every evening for five years. Then into a Japanese version of it eating a certain way chanting in Japanese. And then I quit. So what this is is a low budget film here. I'm sorry I can't answer it. There are holidays but I don't know them.", 'human_start_time': '0:55:32'}, {'talkname': '20061122-Larry_Rosenberg-CIMC-self_knowing_a_quiet_passion_part_29-35547', 'question_num': 'Question 2', 'url': '/talks/35547/20061122-Larry_Rosenberg-CIMC-self_knowing_a_quiet_passion_part_29-35547.mp3', 'display_name': 'Self Knowing: A Quiet Passion Part 29', 'date': '11/22/06 19:00', 'start_time': 3825290, 'content': 'Watch how you live.

Certain emotions may come up that are not great emotions. They get angry for something that's not useful. What do you mean by watch it? Do you step aside and just think take time to get 1005 minutes and say okay I feel myself getting angry. Let's analyze it. Let's look at it. No. Is that what you do? No. You're new to this right? Are pretty new. Yeah. Okay. That's new. You're a newborn Babe. Okay. Yeah. Watch simply means awareness. So we have to start from the beginning. This is for anything that you will ask me. Whether it's anger I'll make it very concrete. I'll do my best to do that. Let's say you're with someone and they say something and you get very angry. Every human being knows what that's like. Okay. So typically what happens is we drown in it. We're just angry. We lash out scream and the extreme kill the person and wind up in San Quentin. Does that still exist? I don't know. Okay that's one extreme. The other is denial where you squash it and you try to be a good person and you don't fully let the anger out. Or maybe of course you restrain yourself because if you don't you could kill someone. And no one wants that to happen. Buddhist no one wants that. But here's the difference. Here's what awareness means. Now you can't really do what I'm saying until the mind has a certain level of steadiness and clarity. Because let's say an untrained mind would find it. There may be exceptions but I haven't run into them. An untrained mind would have a very difficult time being steady aware and nonjudgmental of the energy called anger. It's not thinking. It's not thinking. Anger throw the word anger out. It's energy right? You can feel it in the body. The pulse changes the heart changes your posture changes. Everything changes. You'd be aware of that. Now it's not detachment. What it is is opening up too and feeling that without either drowning in it nor denying it pushing it away fighting with it. Now that sounds like a tall order. And the same for loneliness the same for any kind of fear the same for any. But it's not pulling back. No. To begin with probably most of us do that. But little by little as you keep hearing this enough you realize it's not about detachment. It's more about intimacy. Learning. Now to do that there has to be a certain degree of stability. Now when you do that let's say let's act it out. Now you say something that gets me furious. You haven't. Of course with practice more and more practice doesn't mean just stay on the cushion or come to CIMC or do retreats. That's helpful can be very helpful but it's also meant to be done all in daily life. So let's say this is happening somewhere else not here Harvard Square. But with practice I can learn how to stay attentive to you but not lose touch with myself. To begin with I would lose touch. I'd either get furious or if I have certain kinds of upbringing. Do you really feel that way? Oh I'm sorry. You feel that way? No. Okay I'll be you. But here you would see the shoulders going like this. They would then fall down. You would then feel the ache of the anger maybe the disappointment. It's not that certain kinds of thoughts are forbidden but it isn't so much an analysis of it as when awareness. Think of awareness as energy. Seeing energy mindfulness. So far so good. And think of anger as energy too. That's because that's what I'm talking about. Not the word anger. Okay. Seeing energy touches the energy of anger which is like inflamed there's something in mindfulness. Energy that has a good effect. On whatever it touches. I don't know if you've seen that yet. If not you will if you keep doing this and somehow the anger loses its power a little bit this time and a little bit the next time. Or it may lead to talking it out with the person and telling them how you're feeling. But it's not that you act out but learning can be how you brush your teeth how you do the dishes. Nothing is trivial how you do. You listen when someone else is speaking. Most of us don't listen very well because when someone else is speaking our mind is busy with whatever it's busy with or it can't wait to say what it wants to say which is also very interesting and fascinating in that you're going to just be enthralled with and we kind of listen. And in order to learn the art of listening which is necessary for us humans with each other you learn how you don't listen. Really everyone starts. The art of listening is a very profound art and a very refined one. It takes a lot of work but it's joy. So the point is you approach life whatever your life is rather than with the attitude of intention of judging it all the time of understanding. So I don't want to tell you what you would learn because you'd learn what you learn. But I can't do too much more than this. But at least to get you started. Now that means do you do breath awareness meditation? Okay. Every time you're aware of an in breath and an outbreath you're training the mind to be steadier and clearer. Have you done meta practice here? Loving kindness? Okay. We have a form of meditation called lovingkindness. If someone comes here and they're overwhelmingly negative they get angry at everything they couldn't possibly do. What I'm saying it is just too far away. We have a meditation where we cultivate the opposite of. Okay that's helpful too. It's not exactly going to ever uproot it. Wisdom is kind of seeing it and insight is seeing into the reason we see into our own nature. And as we get to know it for what it is not for what we think it is or what the culture wants us to think it is the mind starts emptying itself and you tap something called emptiness or silence. Once that happens everything changes. But I can't tell you about it. Have you had even a few moments of silence now and then or peace? You mean in daily life? No it's just limited to sitting. Yeah. Okay. That's going to grow. And more and more you'll see that that's the place to live in and to act from whether it's verbal or physical whatever it is. Sometimes you find yourself get angry for no reason. For instance somebody was late visiting me today and I assumed that there would be an inconsiderate this and that. It turns out they were in traffic. So you misjudged the whole situation. Exactly. Get yourself angry over nothing. I wish if you could see that at the beginning you would have saved some misery. Yeah. You start on learning. So this is the last thing that I think there's a limit to what we can do it's better when it grows out of your actual meditation practice. That you learn for yourself and question most of how we behave in daily life before we do anything about it is conditioned. You have your background your parents your school system. You're this you're. That sort of why. And what we think is spontaneous or the real me. It's mechanical so that someone looks at you a certain way and you can't help it. So your way is different that someone else doesn't take it the same way. Everyone is taking the same reality very differently based on their conditioning. This form of meditation is a form of deconditioning. To begin with. You may need to replace negative conditioning with positive but that's just on the way. The real point is to go beyond conditioning. The silence I'm talking about is unconditioned. No culture is touched. It has nothing to do with your history. We're all the same there. Your personality is not there. But then when you tap it you must express it through your equipment. You do it through you. You don't lose that and I do it for me. Are the words a little bit clear?

Sure you mentioned stuff about living in the past in the future but then you're just trying to avoid the present. I usually think of myself as being scared of the future mostly. Like I don't want to be bored. I don't want to be without money. I don't want to be without something to do. Blah blah blah. I'm scared of the present too. I don't want to be bored now. I don't want to be scared now. I don't want to be really facing anything without some kind of Chicago theory or something. And sometimes even the Buddhist concepts turn into another Shiover theory that it's okay to experience things now. It can be. But let's back up because see if your mind is first of all a very basic reflection that I would encourage you to do if you've not done it already. There is no such thing as the future. We're talking about the psychological time when you're envisioning that I might get bored or all those things that you have. You're doing it in the present moment. It's just that it's like a virtual reality like with computers. It's as if you're in some terrible future or someone else. If I meditate and do all this stuff. Oh wow. I can just. And they imagine a future and it feels like you're there but you're not there. You're always here. There's no place else. The past is gone and yet. So we can be in the past as if it's and we relive our suffering over and over because yet you can heal that suffering. But the only way to heal it is now. So there's only now if you get to see that it's very liberating. So you're still spending a lot of time in the future if you're worrying about the future and even the fear of the present unless there's something fearful happening to you very often the fear we're safe. The mind makes up some scenario but it also makes up extraordinary scenarios. The practice is to stay with the facts. The fact for you in a given moment might be that you have fear about something that hasn't happened yet. Your mind is caught up in what might happen. I might be bored. Do you see what I'm getting at? So the practice can only take place in the present moment because life only happens in the present moment. But it seems as if we're in some past or we're in some future now. There's skillful uses of envisioning the future and there are skillful uses of memory. We're not saying throw it all out. It's just that we've been living in anything but to be intimate with the facts of how it is now. And that's where the liberation comes from. By being fully with what's now the suffering the joy whatever it is the 10000 joys and sorrows. So you just told me your particular weather conditions. But we all have our own. It depends on what your content is. But the practice is always the same. Be mindful of it. Watch it's arising and passing away right here and now. You achieved a lot academically. No I didn't feel that. I wish I had. I felt that what I felt was this is what learning is. It's books. And it's only when that crashed and there was more I left out. And I met somebody who said yes book learning is wonderful. But there's another kind of learning which people don't seem to value because very few are doing it. And that's learning about yourself. So at that point it's not that I've rejected. I still study and read and get joy from it. But I spent a year in Korea promising my teacher to not read anything for one year. I needed an extreme measure. I hope you don't need it. I was like a drug addict. I needed strong medicine to wean me from it. A New York Jewish intellectual. I don't know if that means anything to you. It's a certain kind of malfunction. You often get rewarded for it. You can get well paid for it sometimes. But when it becomes at the expense it's not in and of itself at the expense of the quality of your life which you can then that's a misuse of it. But keep going. Do you see what I'm getting at? Yeah. What I'm wondering is the relationship between developing the intellectual mind and also developing spiritual mind. Very important. Yes both are needed. They are both needed. Oh sure. Well in a sense let's say you go into this is a trivial example. You go into a restaurant you've never been in the restaurant and they say what do you want? He said what do you got? And say well I don't know or if they have a men they say well here's a menu. Oh the menu. You don't start chewing on the menu. I would say most spiritual teachings and people call teachers. What we're doing is pointing. It's like Boston if you've never been to Boston it's great there's a sign Boston this way. Not that way not up there. After a while you don't need that sign anymore. You just know how to get okay so we already have a lot of thinking and conclusions about how reality is and how life is and how to live and so forth. This is in a sense another kind of reeducation.

I'm just curious what brings a person to decide to meditate and focus on the breath? Because it seems like. You end up. Going through a large portion of your life sort of not awake and suffering. Right. Sort of just wondering. I just happened to coincidentally run into it. I took a quote that came to doubt on Mindfulness and it's like talking to me there but I'm not sure exactly what it was. And the instructor had mentioned a few different sites if he wanted to further if you were more interested. So that's what brought me here. But it was like it would have been real. I do know that one. It was more extreme for me. There was one point I realized. Why did I waste all those years playing baseball and basketball? None of it interests me anymore. And I could have started meditating right out of the womb. I don't know the answer. And if I knew it I wouldn't even give it to you. Why did you start? What drew you to all this stuff period? Full stop. Great. I can't think of better motivation. That's motivation you can trust. But then what? Then I guess you want to do something about it. Or do you? Well I know you do. You show up. I realized that it was definitely something that I felt like I could grasp on. I felt like I was changing inside which was very. It was encouraging. It just kept giving me the momentum to build on that. But I do have a lot of regrets. Yeah. So have you heard attachment leads to suffering? Oh yeah. Okay. That is how it was. And now your mind resents that my life should have unfold. I should have started much earlier. You can think of that. But that suffering is going to go nowhere. Each one of us has to start when we start it seems. And it's not an even playing field. Some people come out of very damaged childhoods physical liabilities. The difference among young people even when you see little right after birth temperaments are so different. So this practice is not to compare yourself with anyone else. But you always start with yourself as you are right here and now. So in that sense you're always beginning again. And it has nothing to do with the person sitting to the left or right of you. This is where you have to start. The other is a question. The Buddha wouldn't answer questions like that. The reason he wouldn't is because it'll go nowhere. We could play a game and reflect well because the fact is. But why are you asking the question today? That's what I really want to know. I'm going to make you work. I did my share. Now I'm going to make you guys work. Why are you asking that question now? But why are you asking it now? But finally. Okay why do you need to hear about what? About me? Why what's so interesting about it? Okay let's spend the rest of the day. Everyone will just all go. But you see what brought me is not so different from what brought you. Okay? I don't want to be cruel. I'll satisfy your hunger for my biography which came a point where the gap between my resume very successful outwardly academically and the inner poverty became like Grand Canyon. Now I don't know relative to other people it's not like I was a serial killer or anything like that. But relative to how I thought I should be feeling because I was teaching at a super duper school and how I actually was feeling. And as I looked around that's what I meant by disillusionment. That is I had growing up a lot of growing up is. But see disillusionment sometimes implies despair and you give up and you're despondent. And that's not what I'm talking about although that can certainly be part of it to begin with. It's like we have so many illusions. Idealizations. And if you live and pay attention they start crumbling. Because an ideal isn't what life is. Life is just what it is. And the mind is constantly manufacturing images. The most important one is images of ourselves. When Bodi Dharma who brought what is called Zen now from India to China was asked by the Emperor who are you? In other words he was saying all these things the Emperor didn't like hearing because they undercut the Emperor's wanting to be congratulated for being so generous and donating money for this temple and these monks and nuns in that monastery. Who are you that's saying all these things and Bodhi darmor's answer one translation which the one I prefer is. I have no idea. Does that mean he's lost walking around Harvard Square like this? Just the opposite. It means he knows he's not an idea about himself. He just is there's a beingness or isness? See now if you start watching your mind you're going to see how many fabrications Sankaras the mind makes up about itself. And then of course there's one where I'm a Vipassana Yogi or a Zen Yogi or Tibetan Yogi or whatever you like. And then that one it goes on forever. Then of course the most subtle one is I'm nothing. I'm like Bodi Dharma. I don't know who I am. You can forge that into an identity. So finally it's letting go as one of my teachers put it. And this is one of my favorite teachings. Don't make anything. Then you can have everything. As Bodie Dharma was not confused. He was clear. He's not saying I'm conventionally. Fine. I'm an Indian Monk who's come here to teach the Buddhist teaching. As long as you're not confused and you know that that's on the level of language a conventional language has its role. But he was bodied Arma because he wasn't living from a place of notions about himself. But something much deeper when you start letting go of all his baggage. See we've created a very small place to live in and we're trying to fix it up where it's sometimes called a prison and we want to have golden bars instead of steel bars. And the teachings are saying Get out of prison period. The question isn't replacing a dingy prison with one that maybe has a little more fresh air and some rehab activities in a library is to get out of prison period. The prison is self made. We've created a notion of who we are which we then believe in and then we try to improve it. We are tormented by it. We present it to others. They see it or they don't see it. Of the vastness that is each of us has access to. Everyone in this hall has access to. We've enclosed it through thinking and notions and images. It's a very tiny possibility is where we're living our life out. One of the things the Buddha is saying we're ignorant of ignorance is another term for disillusionment. Yes for disillusion for illusion. Sorry. Is that we're ignorant of our full potential. And everyone has the same full potential which is named different things. Now I didn't come to this because I wanted to attain Nirvana or anything of that sort. I started looking. I knew that I knew more about everything else than I knew about myself. And I saw that I was paying for it. So that's what got me started. But if that helps you to keep going. But I see you come here. You seem very committed and have plenty of energy. You don't need my biography anymore. First of all. I'm like you. I've seen the light. Once I was in darkness and now I've seen the light. Born again Buddhist please. Okay. Let me be clear about what is being said also this inquiry self knowing. When I said that it changes as your practice ripens and matures. At the beginning there would be much more like investigation and inquiry and some of that would be on a psychological level. And very often. I know I do and I know Michael and Ryan do as well. We'll suggest people go into therapy if they're not in it or there are some therapists who meditate. And so we work together because some forms of therapy are better equipped to handle certain things than we are or both together. It's very much an individual matter. As time unfolds less and less. Do you have to? Because this kind of investigation has some thinking in it. It's a kind of active intervention. Let's see. Why am I this way? What's going on here? What's happening? Trying to understand and it can be valuable but what I'm talking about awareness. You say let go of your story. Yeah. Okay. You have to be careful there in my opinion because I hear letting go is very it's coin of the realm in Dharma centers everyone's letting go of everything because you find out that that's what's valued here. Right. The Buddha said let go. But when you listen closely some of it is pushing away or throwing away or letting go of something you don't really want anyway. It does. So what's the big deal? Often letting go is synonymous with letting be. So let's say your storyline comes up. It's not a matter of crushing it. It's a matter of being aware of the mind and starting to learn what's going on. What the mind is doing is making up a story about who you are and then we identify. We are the storyteller. We're the audience we're the whole show. It's Marcel Marceau. I don't know if anyone remembers him. It was a one woman show a one man show where the mind is making up doing the whole thing and then liberation is from our story in the sense. And the letting go isn't so much as cut as beginning to feel the difference between words and images that tell you who you are and how it is. And when you see them they tend to fall away. And what you're left with is just pure awareness. So that finally the direction we're going in is you find that finally who you are is awareness. It's awareness itself but it isn't what you think it is right now necessarily. And that awareness will express itself through your equipment and through my words we won't be interchangeable. We're not going to be fungible goods. That is someone has a musical gift or a medical gift or whatever it is. Their clear mind will express itself through those tendencies. So the person is still an individual. It's not like you no longer recognizable as an individual. But the awareness I'm talking about is learning how to widen your capacity to receive your own experience fully intimately without judging it. It's not analyzing it. It's not interpreting it. It's not figuring out. Oh this is because that although at the beginning I think there is more of that and some of that can be helpful. What I'm saying is as time goes on the letting go is far superior than figuring out your personality. And that brings you an energy that is superior. And more and more you want to live from that energy. It's clearer. It has more wisdom and kindness in it. And you start to see that rather than keep patching up the personality and trying to figure out what's wrong with it and fixing it endlessly. I don't think it can. I think personalities it's quicksand. It's just always changing changing and life keeps changing. And then it's stuck. It's like ten years ago or even older. Whereas what we're talking about is self knowing is being fresh right here and right now. Now the ego doesn't like when it hears what I'm saying. It's terrified because that means it's out of business or it doesn't reign supreme anymore. You still have a personality. You would be noticeably different than me et cetera all of us. Am I getting at what you're saying? I'm not sure. Try again because I haven't. Okay. What's left over that hasn't been dealt with?", 'human_start_time': '0:00:21'}, {'talkname': '20050604-Larry_Rosenberg-CIMC-how_to_live-42069', 'question_num': 'Question 2', 'url': '/talks/42069/20050604-Larry_Rosenberg-CIMC-how_to_live-42069.mp3', 'display_name': 'How to Live', 'date': '6/4/05 19:00', 'start_time': 3733090, 'content': "Something things off in my understanding. I don't want to sit so that I don't. Okay you don't have to feel sad or there's all this stuff to be grateful for. And maybe you've made several mistakes and you're. You see I am addressing myself to that in my big fat opinion because that isn't the choice. The choice is to look at the sadness. Now sometimes the sadness is very potent or you try to do it practically and you're overwhelmed by it. You bring mindfulness to it and you get enveloped. So then sometimes it's practical. Switch to channel breath switch to channel meta lovingkindness. Switch to taking a nice walk in nature whatever. But more and more this is a wisdom path and wisdom is understanding. Wisdom grows. Self knowing is the first step in the development of wisdom. If you don't want to know yourself but you want to be a wise person it's like saying you want to be a surgeon but you don't want any get blood all over you. It just makes no sense. So it doesn't mean either or. There are times. It's not that you don't appreciate nature and I don't know you but of course you have a lot of blessings. But there's also this sadness that let's say it's a loss of a certain kind. So it's not either or it's learning skillfully how to work with them. And what I'm saying is at the beginning we're more likely see what you are doing a lot of is useful thinking. Or it would be Dharma reflections insightful reflections. Well it could be something. It's not the end of the world. This tool will pass. I did my best. I couldn't help it or whatever it is. But that's the mind trying to talk itself into a better place. That's okay. What I'm saying is as the practice ripens you do less and less of that because more and more you want to live in what is just the way it is. You'll see because that's how you transcend what is what is is just now. It is nothing. But now. So that some of the things you mentioned are useful. You can keep doing them but more and more can you be aware of sadness. Not the word but the okay. And if you feel that it's too much or you're unable to do it in a particular sitting find some other skillful way to keep awareness alive even though you're not. But you know what you're doing. It's not repression or denial. You realize Whoa I'm very sad but I'm not up to it today. It's not denial. It's sort of like a skillful. I know I'm sad and I know I can't do it. My awareness is not steady enough. It's just practical. So I better go back and do some more breath awareness do some walking. So we're bringing the mind into a condition where it's more able to accomplish what these words are suggesting. Do you see what I'm getting at? And so each person's practice doesn't unfold in a nice and tidy way. That's one of the roles for exchanges like this is your life has to unfold in your way. And how can this practice be of any help or can it be of any help? We have to take your condition in its own right. But more and more the whole point of what the Buddha is saying is that you're going to do it yourself. Be a lamp unto yourself. It's one of the last messages of the Buddha. That doesn't mean we can't accept help but finally we're learning how to stand on our own. 2ft if you're sad you know that the sadness has to be taken care of. And the best way to take care of it is through awareness a nonjudgmental and some reflection like what you were doing. There's nothing wrong with that. Want me to do all the work? It's not going to happen. Please. Sure.", 'human_start_time': '1:02:13'}, {'talkname': '20050604-Larry_Rosenberg-CIMC-how_to_live-42069', 'question_num': 'Question 3', 'url': '/talks/42069/20050604-Larry_Rosenberg-CIMC-how_to_live-42069.mp3', 'display_name': 'How to Live', 'date': '6/4/05 19:00', 'start_time': 3992130, 'content': "You had said that by watching your. Suffering. What you're asking is fear or whatever you're feeling. If you watch it you create an awareness of acceptance. Awareness is awareness. Acceptance is an attitude. Now I know people talk that way accept everything that's happened to you. That's in the right direction. But what I'm talking about is the art of pure observation as allowing it to be what it is. Say you have a situation that goes you have to deal with every day. That creates fear in you in daily life. We're talking about that. Sure. It's not just sitting. Let's say you're in this situation I'm making this up. So you go to work and there's a situation that produces fear in you a lot. It's not that you have to run home to your cushioned scurry home and go sit or go to the ladies room and out. That might help a little bit too. But you can with practice learn how to be in touch with the fear maintain some inner focus as you're engaged in action because otherwise this is saying this is all passivity fatalism. No life goes on. And we have to do the best we can with how we are. As of right now we can't wait till we're perfect. We're all seeing all compassionate beings. We can't on the way is we're learning and living learning and living and learning. But you see if you enjoy that process rather than getting fixated on getting the degree at the end which is I'll be a totally happy person and they'll give me a certificate. You are completely and totally happy and free. It only took me 40 years. Rather the process what we're saying is practice. Okay. So now you walk into work and it starts I'm making something up. You start at your desk and ex walks in and you can feel heart rate changes the shoulders change. With practice you can learn how to maintain your inner focus. As you pay attention to ex he or she is your superior and you do the job little by little. Now sometimes you have to mainly your attention has to be on the job. You have to understand the instructions. And other times you're a little bit more here. But typically we're cut off from our experience. Certainly when in action we're too busy we're totally out there. Or if you're afraid you already have a history of being afraid. That's why you're telling me about it right. So what happens? You either bear it right? You're going through the day afraid or you have ways of setting it aside. So it's bearable. You tell me what do you do? How do you handle it? As of now what does that mean? I just came to this country. I don't know what it means. What does working through it meaning? Sitting. Yeah. Sitting a little bit more regularly. And I find it helps me cope with the situation a little bit better. That's right. So are you saying anything different than I'm saying? How about throwing all your expectations away? But you see then we have to get clear. What do you mean by awareness? I'm sorry to be so nitpicking but I have to be. People will say oh I do that. What is that? Yeah. Oh lonely. Let's go out and have a this means a real openness to it feeling it. It becomes up when you sit. Great. Not great. But that's what's there. So that's what you practice with and throughout the day. Maybe there are also our reflections. Now coping is not good enough. Granted we have to do it to begin with. Coping postponing. This is what we already do. We're experts at postponing. Someday I'll tell that person over I'll explain to them why I don't. But someday and then 20 years when is this someday going to come? We don't. Because I'm afraid. Why are you afraid? Because I'll lose my job. If I'm honest with my boss that might be true. And I have five children I have to support. So this isn't saying go into the streets and become homeless in the name of so then you have to work with the fact that in this situation you can't tell this person everything. But do you have to suffer along with it so much? In other words can you ease your burden? The person is not going to change. Sometimes what happens is when you change they change without even knowing it. There's a circuit going on. We're all doing it to each other. But what I'm talking about is an openness and a receptivity acceptance. Here's why I'm careful about acceptance. That's like you talk yourself into. I just have to learn how to accept these things because they're inevitable. They're part of my work situation that's in the right direction. But the art of self observation is pure than that. There's no thinking in it. None. It's like a clear mirror with no scratches no flaws. And so you're feeling. We call that fear. Let's say little by little the fear starts to thin out. But also we begin to understand. Why am I afraid? You may see that the source of the fear are thoughts that you have just before the fear started. Someone comes in and then their thoughts oh here comes X and they're going to do it again. He she did it yesterday and two days ago and it's going to come. And then once those thoughts start in then the fear automatically. So that's what self knowing is. You start to understand how your mind behaves in that situation. I can't give you just sit down breathe in and out in out in and out. It's not a mechanical process. It's artistic in this sense. Ingenuity is needed. Subtlety reflection sensitivity as you come time to stand yourself in the situation. And like at the beginning there is some thinking and some reflection which has some thought in it. But they're wise reflections because typically we have thoughts anyway. But they're more. He is a rotten boss and I'm a good worker and they still do this to me. We waste all of our energy just on the outer world. Maybe true maybe they are a terrible boss. But in the meantime we're suffering and coping and putting up with and postponing and the years go by. So if you more and more can take care of what's happening the mind gets clearer and then what to do? To say or what to do including quitting in my example. I don't know if it's work. Why not tell me that? Why not tell me that child with a chronic illness. What? Okay look this is why I'm inviting you to join me. I told you about my childhood. Right now it's not that I want to nosy but see the principle is the same but it's a bit different because here's a child. Right. Okay so some of it is reflection. The child is doing the best that the child can. But then what is it bringing up in you? It could bring up disappointment frustration anger whatever. The point is not that there's a special way you're supposed to feel well if it's a mother well mothers love their children. A good mother wouldn't be like this. But I want to strangle it's. Training and honesty this whole self knowing project. And so it's not to strangle a child but it's to begin to see resistances and frustrations. And also you can use reflection like the child came into the world this way. But now the degree to which you work on the impact the child's having on you enables you to be a better adult in terms of being more helpful with the child the degree to which you're not working on yourself. Maybe you'll behave according to some should some ideal. A good mother a good therapist a good nurse a good whatever it is by all means express yourself in a motherly if that's what it is or whatever kind way. But don't lose touch with what's really going on because as you do it loses power. And I think you have to understand as the mind gets clearer you have access to a resource that you may not know you have right now. And so I have to tell you you have it. That doesn't mean it's true but it may be true. How will you find out? There's a tremendous finally meditation is an explosion of love. If wisdom doesn't explode and it's the same thing there's no separation then the love I'm talking about is not I love you honey booby. If you leave me. I'm not talking about that. It's something much deeper and different. But as the mind stops getting caught on its own productions identifications which limit you the mind you experience it it becomes more spacious and more silent. Okay. And as you can tap that silence the silence is highly charged with life. And what's in it to me that's why I become a mystic. At a certain point. I don't know what's going on but I know when my mind gets quiet the most important healing goes on there. I come out of it more compassionate. I wasn't practicing anything. I was just allowing the silence to work on me. And so in this tradition we sometimes call it the original mind not who you think you are which is an accumulation of your life experiences conditions Mama Papa school and all the rest. Who your original mind? Your original mind? There's no suffering in that mind. It never was. There never will be hard to believe. How will you test it? We have to get through the ordinary mind in order to taste it at least here. But if you even get a glimpse of it more and more that gives you a resource that you didn't have before. More love more patience. But it's not like you're cultivating patience or love it's. That it's in us. And that's when the Buddhist says you have immense potential. All spiritual teachings are saying this but we don't know it. So how do you tap that potential this way? The path of self knowing or wisdom is through knowing yourself and letting go of pretty much all of it. Who are you? I have no idea. If you enjoy learning let's back up. Many of us have enjoyed learning and some of us maybe all of us know it also isn't such joy because once the school system gets hold of learning and then it becomes ambition and striving and career and who gets fired and who gets hired who gets tenure and who gets this? It's poison but pure learning in and of itself. Watch a child learn what happens to like all the people in Central Square who have been battered by life at one point I think most if not all of them were sweet little children. What happened to them? Something did. But if you watch a child learning watch a child learning how to walk. They fall down. They get up. They fall down and there's glee there and they fall down. They're not like us yet. They don't say well when these children start learning to walk one year yeah well the kid next door he learned at six months. Then you fall down and say I'm no good. Then we have to go into infant therapy. And the child doesn't do that yet. They enjoy the process of learning. Now what is being suggested here is that whatever your relationship to learning there must be there's something good about learning. It's good now even if it's been poisoned can we save it? Can we resurrect it in some way? But the learning here is not about biology et cetera. It's learning about yourself. If you can enjoy the process and that includes seeing suffering and that includes seeing things we don't want to be there. But you understand that you're doing the most skillful thing you can do for yourself. You're opening up to the truth of how things are for you. Now whether the promise of the Buddha and others that there's an incredible reality waiting for you. Personally I have had a little bit of a glimpse of it or I'd be an idiot to teach this stuff. Well people do it but you don't believe me. Maybe I'm just pretending to be so open. So you'll believe in me and that I really just memorized all this stuff? Could be I'm in the business. You should not trust me. Listen to me carefully but don't trust me. Watch me carefully. You'll see that I plan asked my wife there. Just take out the garbage. That's the main thing. If you're lucky you'll fall in love with the process not with the reward at the end of the rainbow. That if I do this if I just sit. And how many retreats do I have to do? How long do I have to sit? Am I ready for the three month retreat yet? It's like jogging. I see. There are two categories for me. The joyless joggers are the ones that's medicinal. For some it's good for you. It's like cod liver oil. Everyone's hating. And then there are people who really like to run. It's so different. They're not necessarily even fast but they just enjoy it.

And part of the reason I got into this is because part of the treatment I do is based on Zen Buddhism. And part of the core skills to teach people who are having trouble regulating their emotions is mindfulness. Are you mindful of yourself? I am much more mindful of myself. All sitting is practicing that. But it's practicing it in a very protected way so that you have a chance of really refining that process. You can get much more concentrated than at the beginning as possible in the complexity of living and the fact that it's hard for you. I think that's a universal experience. The mind is wild to begin with. But you don't only have to sit. You can also practice as we're saying everything in life practice mindfulness. But does sitting have something very precious to offer that? I would say it does. It isn't just sit if you want don't sit if you don't want. I haven't seen that to be so because especially see at a certain point the sitting produces tremendous joy tremendous and also tremendous sorrow. Whatever is there. Look the practice is about being mindful of what's there. That's as we say the bottom line can you do that? And we can't. We're learning how to do that. No matter what it is sadness this. X-Y-Z. Okay so when you try to sit you get discouraged because what? Your mind is wild. Yeah. I'll either sit long enough and feel like I'm not getting calmed down or my mind is still going. Okay. And then they're suffering right? Yeah of course. Well maybe this is in the moment. Your mind isn't getting calm. You don't like that right? Okay so sometimes we have to acknowledge suffering. We don't want to admit that we're suffering as if it's an insult. It's quite a step to be humble enough to be able to say I'm suffering for all of us. But at any rate can we have a show of hands? Because I look around. Many of you have been sitting quite a while. How many of you had a very difficult time at the beginning? Look around about this side so you don't have to feel lonely. Now at least you know you've got company. And not only that not only that. If you read the ancient text it's always been so the Tibetans talked about. See you've attained the Cascading mind. You already have an accomplishment. The Cascading mind is like Waterfall mind. He said. She said maybe when. Oh Whoa. All over the place. If you see that then you know my goodness this is the condition of my mind. Okay that's true. And then you can duck out of it. And it's a dangerous place because people get discouraged. A fork in the road. You're going to say this is hopeless. How can I ever calm down? Look how wild the mind is. What I'm saying is countless people before you many of them sitting in this room have had the same feelings even of discouragement. And there's a fork in the road. You can choose. I can't do it. It's not for me. What was your term? Self. Bad self image or something. All right self. Okay here's just another way to reinforce that one. Exactly. But then there's another fork and the fork has two. Right. The other path which I would encourage you to take is that there is help. The cavalry is on the way. You know the cowboy movies? Yes certainly. Keep at it. But there's more than keeping at it. Help. When you sit with a group of people it's easier. That's why we do because we all keep each other. We inspire each other. And then people like me sideshow Barkers. My job is to keep talking it up when you need it at a certain point. And some of you I can see in your faces you've had enough. When is he going to shut up? Right. Admit it. But I wish I could. Do you think I liked laughing like this? Some of it is chronic psychological illness that I have but a lot of it is that I can see that many people need to hear more. But let's back up. See there's already wisdom possible. You're sitting and you sit for 20 minutes and you're still not calm. And you've heard this is development of peace and calm. And you want it because you know what? The absence is. Okay but then it isn't happening then and then the mind it's not happening now. One of the main wisdom teachings is a very basic one is that craving an attachment causes suffering so that this is a small case of it so that you can save something from it by realizing oh I'm suffering right now. You don't have to wait until you're tremendously red hot concentrated before wisdom can come up any time with just your ordinary mind and you begin to recognize I'm suffering in this moment. I get it. First Noble truth there is suffering in human life. Second Noble truth happens when I want things to be other than the way they are. And as a result I suffer. And you see oh and there's a certain joy of learning that can come from that even if you might think it's a small thing but you learned it for yourself. See if you just read in a Buddhist book it's interesting and it might be even impressive tears streaming down your cheek. But when you discover it for yourself it's very different. It's your own now and then. Let that spread so that more and more some days are rough to be with the breath others are not. So the learning can actually help you ease into this. It's not just raw patience putting up with it until one of these days I'll get it. And I'll be really peaceful. I see that. Okay one last one. And then I think we ought to do some sitting together. If not I'm going to put something on your mind since maybe it's not something that warrants discussion. More and more people are talking about what's happening in the world and feeling discouraged and frightened. For example I'm in touch with the Russian Jewish immigrant community. My wife is of that background. And some of the immigrants I would say this is every immigrant goes through this. It's part of growing up have a very romantic idealized view of what America is. And then they come here and then they find out Enron and then they find out all these people don't have medical coverage. And then we make war on Iraq. Why? And suddenly disillusionment America isn't what I wanted it to be. I thought we project onto it what it's going to do fix everything. And it never did and it never will and it certainly isn't doing it now. There are Americans now who are born here who also feel concerned. I don't remember it being like this where just a lot of the directions seem unconstructive and unkind and all about money. Just money piling it up for some and fear of unemployment a fear of perhaps there's a draft. If you have children will I have to go into the military. Don't rule that out because there are now views that we might have to stay in Iraq forever. Not literally a long time. Well no one's signing up right? People are not signing up for the job anymore. 40% down in the military. No one wants to know. Parents want their children to go over there and die for what? Okay they're not sure. We are sure that it is a good reason. Fine. But so far there are many people who are not convinced yet. If ever there may not be none. And we're bombarded with it day in and day out. Cnn Fox et cetera et cetera. If that isn't a source of anything then of course let's not talk about it. But it is for some people. Now the disillusionment again is part of growing because finally here's the challenge for us as I see it. This is the world we actually live in. Do you know that whatever you want to say Bush this one that one Rumsfeld money goes to whatever you want. This is the world we live in. This is a fact. And most people don't meditate are not vegetarian and don't feel the way you do and maybe are rude and maybe throw their discard their debris on the sidewalk. People are not living the way you want them to. And that may be true always. There's an ancient phrase. The poor have always been with us. I'm not fatalistic about it. But the point is this Dharma practice is learning how to go to that place which is untouched by CNN which has nothing to do with good news bad news in between news. And it doesn't mean not be compassionate. If you want to be a political activist by all means but let it come from a place that's more reliable than anger and hatred whatever it is. This is the world we have to learn how to live in. We're going to have to learn if nothing else a world of nonmeditators. When practice get strong people have a practice. I'm watching all these people. They make so much suffering for themselves sort of what I'm telling you now. And then they start seeing everyone. Why don't they learn how to meditate? There are just so much unnecessary suffering and you see all the flaws and pimples and everyone maybe not yourself. Well that's a phase that you have to go through. Disillusion with America is part of growing up. I've had to tell one Russian person can you forgive America for not being perfect? It's human. And are there any good things going on here? I said of course I say okay but this is what I say. Would you like to go back to Russia? Not to wait. It often says go back to Russia. I said Would you like to return to Russia? Okay. But this is true. It is this way right now so we're not helpless. What this is about if you want to change the world. Start with yourself and everyone will do that differently. Some of you may be politically active and all right. Great. Do it. Some of you may be concerned with ecology and pure air and pure water. Very high priority. Incredibly high do that. There's no one way to live a wise and kind life. But step number one is at least from this point of view is start with yourself again and again and again. Because whatever it is that we are that's the stamp we put on everything we do you can't deliver to the world or your children or whatever more than who you are. So we're working on that. On the who. One last one. No let's sit if you want to stand first. It's okay and stretch.", 'human_start_time': '1:22:36'}, {'talkname': '19950827-Larry_Rosenberg-UNK-bringing_the_practice_home-1511', 'question_num': 'Question 1', 'url': '/talks/1511/19950827-Larry_Rosenberg-UNK-bringing_the_practice_home-1511.mp3', 'display_name': 'Bringing The Practice Home', 'date': '8/27/95 0:00', 'start_time': 1546010, 'content': "I think I would like to add another dimension of our experience which both underlies and accompanies the practice of mindfulness. And that is the necessity for cultivating a sense of moral integrity. There are two fruits to this practice wisdom and compassion. They go hand in hand and one doesn't come to the final goal with only one. So a concern for how we live our lives the way in which we do things is imperative. The precepts are very simple. So simple that they may seem to have nothing to do with us. Not to kill not to steal not to lie not to conduct ourselves sexually in any immoral way not to indulge in intoxicants. We're all decent people and we probably feel none of this is relevant. But the interesting thing about this little list of injunctions is that they can be refined and refined and refined. Not to kill not to destroy life if we take that seriously turns itself around so that we begin to respect life. Care about this person or this plant or this animal this situation to care about it to want to nurture it help it to prosper in a brand new way. To leave here knowing that we need to be mindful is part of what the great lesson is. The other part is to leave knowing that we need to be careful with what we do. And the more mindful we are the more careful we become. They go hand in hand. But let this also be a dimension of your active concern from now on. Thank you. We have a few moments left. Any questions about the daily life aspect of practice? Please. How long should the incident. Have you been here for the whole retreat? Yes. Okay. What the emphasis is on is not unregulating the breath at all just allowing the breath to happen naturally. And so whatever the interval is that's what it is. But the gap does grow as the breathing becomes more conscious. What happens is the breath becomes more refined more subtle. In fact it gets to the point where it feels as if you're not breathing at all. But it's nothing to worry about. But when the mind gets very quiet please dispense with what? Yes. Do you think the Buddha was a lazy person? Yes I understand some of it has to do with the misconception that we all have or we don't have the experience that is it's as if the only way we can arouse energy develop energy is through competition somehow. If we don't develop competition we'll all be under a tree having siesta time just lying in hammocks and just sleeping for 20 hours a day. There is another energy that people can work from called love. There's a tremendous motivation that comes from a different source altogether. I don't think Mother Teresa is competing with anyone. Maybe she is but it doesn't seem like she is. So the point is it isn't the only way to even develop human excellence but in our culture and maybe many cultures. For all I know most competition has been used in that way. To enter into life wholeheartedly and fully does not require comparison. It is not the only way to generate energy although it's the one that probably most of us have been brought up with. And so it's hard to understand that a tremendous kind of energy can come which has nothing to do with comparison at all. Now some of this gets easier as the meditation deepens because as the meditation deepens what you discover is you have a source of energy which is before thinking you don't need to in a sense play mental games to arouse motivation because all the energy you could ever want is already in you. All of us have it. No one's been short changed. But as long as the energy is tied up on the level of concepts likes and dislikes and so forth we're not in a sense as being dispersed. As the mind gets quieter not only do you find you have tremendous energy. But for example take the precepts. To begin with we have there are methods in Buddhism which cultivate lovingkindness compassion. It's sort of working from the outside in necessary to replace a lot of destructive patterns that we have. As you go deeper you'll find that what we call compassion seems to be innate certain that real love comes from within. It's not something that needs to be cultivated. So when you see somebody who's hungry you would like to do something to see to it that they're fed. It doesn't have to have the striving ambition craving and all that the four Noble Truths imply. Do you see what I'm getting at? Yes. Some of the greatest suffering in this world has come from religion hasn't it? By all kinds of people who have the answer for us. And a lot of attempts that what you're talking about have produced incalculable human suffering. In the name of God in the name of Christianity in the name of anything. How we go about being of use to the world makes all the difference. The motivation where we are. You see if our work towards trying to improve the world is still basically lodged in the ego it's still essentially in the service of me and mine then what we do is likely to be less effective. The urge to do something for other people to help other people is best done if you've taken care of your own suffering. Definitely. What we're suggesting here is for many of us a shift in priorities. It's not that you abandon the world until you get to be perfect but part of the problem has been that a lot of people trying to change everyone else who have not begun to work on themselves. We want a peaceful world and then we blame particular leaders who brought us to war whereas really we're all responsible. If you're against war do you still have any violence in yourself? Are you still dealing with aggression in ways in which you're harsh and cruel not singling you out? All of us. If you're going to become someone trying to end war and you haven't begun to end the war on yourself do you think you have much of a chance of being useful? So it's not either or because actually this is a difficult one for people to get especially at the beginning. I often get asked this question isn't it selfish to do all this meditation? There's so much to be done outside out there in the world. This is not saying to eliminate soup kitchens charity and so forth. Not at all. But in a very profound way. The greatest gift that you can give life is you. That is if you work on your limitations ways in which you're handicapped in terms of let's say relations with humans meditation is about that. However you are however each one of us is that's what we have to give people? We put our stamp on everything we do. And so if you the greatest contribution to the world would be a few more sane gentle genuinely peace loving people. So when you work on yourself if you see it in a snapshot way you just look at a person or look at them. They're just sitting in their cushion for two days. That seems pretty self indulgent and selfish. It can be. This meditation can be misused and just be another exercise in narcissism high class narcissism. But that's not what the practice is designed to do. Quite the contrary. So as you work on yourself that's what you bring to the world. And whatever your work is should you want to do good works in the world? Wonderful. The world needs all the help you can get. But it might be coming from a place of sanity and fulfillment rather than again the ego coloring what it does and backfiring. Because of its nature the ego can never be happy. I don't know if you agree with that. I would be willing to make that an absolute. It is impossible for the ego to be happy. I've seen this for myself. There's no way in which your ego can be happy. If you want to go about perfecting it good luck. It's a hopeless task. So in this way of looking at things as you work on yourself you're also working on the world. After all you are the world. You're part of it. Is that getting closer? Yeah. One quick one. No I didn't say don't try to change the world. The world could use some changing. But let's make sure. Yes.", 'human_start_time': '0:25:46'}, {'talkname': '19950827-Larry_Rosenberg-UNK-bringing_the_practice_home-1511', 'question_num': 'Question 2', 'url': '/talks/1511/19950827-Larry_Rosenberg-UNK-bringing_the_practice_home-1511.mp3', 'display_name': 'Bringing The Practice Home', 'date': '8/27/95 0:00', 'start_time': 2285130, 'content': "How do you deal with the situation especially when you're buying food? Yes I understand. Okay. You've asked a big question actually. How to meditate in a world of nonmeditators how to be a vegetarian in a world of meat eaters. I can't answer that for you except that I live under those conditions. I'm vegetarian. Most of the people that I know are not. I allow them the right to eat the way they want to. They know the same things. I know they say I don't go around preaching all day long about slaughterhouses and all the rest of it. Now and then it does come out. I for example remember being these people. I think it was at a retreat year where there were four or five people who were in animal rights and were doing active work about not to purchase fur coats and how animals are used for cosmetic experimentation. And then I assumed that they were vegetarian. And I said Well I guess you're vegetarian right? And I said oh no we're not vegetarian. So I said Well I don't get it. If you kill animals for a fur coat it's no good. But if you kill it to eat them it's all right. Did you ask the animals what they think about it? But if you want to change the whole planet to vegetarianism I would just good luck. I don't think you can. I also I'm not sure that that's the highest see what the world is really lacking from this point of view is understanding. If there was more understanding a lot of things would change. I don't know if everyone would automatically become vegetarian. Probably not. There are many. The Dalai Lama eats meat and Arnold Hitler was vegetarian. That makes things a little complicated. So you have to in a sense your challenge I think will be because for all of us I certainly know what you're talking about is to have respect for other people's way of life. For example respect people's right to not meditate. Some of you may. If you've become very zealous about how wonderful the possum is be careful how you can now spread it to your parents and your children. And it doesn't work. Just exemplify it in your action. By the same token if you're going to turn everyone into a vegetarian I hope I'm not around when you start doing it. Let it be a lesson. Take care of yourself. You'll be vegetarian. But then again finally you'll have to decide. I mean maybe you can't buy meat for them. Maybe it's really repulsive for you so that you can only shop for yourself and someone else has to go out and buy the meat. I don't know. But that's what wisdom is about. Wisdom always has a particular context and a particular application. You can read wise books that are wise in general. And then when finally you look around your house and it's crawling with ants and you have to decide do I kill them or don't I kill them? Each person has to decide. The precepts. Finally is your relationship with yourself. There's no palazzi there's no police that are going to enforce the five precepts. It's about your relationship with yourself. And if all of us took those precepts seriously that is as a reflection knowing that it may be impossible to 100% follow any of those precepts. I myself think that sell which is no reason to not be Orient. It gives you an orientation like the North Star. You'll never reach the North Star but you at least know the direction. It gives you the right direction. The five precepts give us the right direction. And sometimes life is just much more complicated and things happen. So that's about it. Okay. This will have to be our last. Yes very good. What you said in the following way don't work for improving the world. And I don't know whether that's what you said. I think that's not what I got. Because if first we work on our substance really change our house we may never get to work. Yeah I'm not saying that. Yes. But also we have to allow for individual differences. For example this is a very complicated one. Some people have a very strong contemplative dimension. They're natural contemplatives to insist that that person be serving in soup kitchens and doing all kinds of other good work that's needed out there is a mistake because they can be of more benefit to the human race by going deeply because of their particular gift. Again they of course will have contact with people. There are certain hermits. I spend time with a number of hermits in Asia. One hermit who'd be lived in a cave for he didn't even know how long and he didn't know how old he was was an extraordinary gift to the human race. And he wasn't doing social good in our terms. But when people would come to visit him something that he learned by being alone and by going deeply into silence gave him a clarity that was so helpful to someone like myself who had come from a very busy life. So I wouldn't want to squeeze everyone into the same mold. Some people may not meditate at all or do very little meditation but their way of doing their path may be much more of good works. I wouldn't want to say that they have to be squeezed into retreat life all the time because they're not going to be able to do it. They don't want to do it. So we have to allow for a variety of different ways to live usefully. We don't have a long time to live on this planet. It seems to me in the simplest terms how can we live most usefully? And when we leave have done something useful whatever that is and each person has to find their own way of their own choice. What I am saying is personally I do a fair amount of sitting and I've done at times a lot of sitting but I don't just sit. I'm involved with people. I do my best with my parents who are now elderly. I do my best in other ways and yet my priority is very high on this. But I don't feel that this is the only way that everyone's just somehow got to sit on the cushion for months on end. To me that would be childish. Do you see what I'm getting at so that you can grow in both realms simultaneously? What I am saying is right now the planet is overdeveloped in terms of applying intelligence to technology to the mastery of outer reality. It's brilliant. The computers are extraordinary and we have not grown since probably since Stone Age times. We're just as primitive. The mind that hit you with a club now hit you with a button that sends a missile. Have we really developed so there's definitely some redresses needed. We've got to move things more towards. There is an uncharted frontier. It's inner. We're totally undeveloped. Certainly the modern world is undeveloped. The ancients knew more about this it seems. Certainly some ancient civilizations. So from that point of view we're redressing an imbalance. But all the time standing that there's individual variation. We all have a different part to play. Why don't we end on that note? Could we have a moment silence please.", 'human_start_time': '0:38:05'}, {'talkname': '19840211-Larry_Rosenberg-UNK-five_hindrances-1589', 'question_num': 'Question 1', 'url': '/talks/1589/19840211-Larry_Rosenberg-UNK-five_hindrances-1589.mp3', 'display_name': 'Five Hindrances', 'date': '2/11/84 0:00', 'start_time': 833450, 'content': "Is there could be an appropriate wanting of intention to go acting in a certain direction. That's good to explore. Is there a legitimate anger? But you see when people get angry we all feel that it's legitimate. Who's to decide? It may be legitimate. Maybe the whole human race would agree that's legitimate but the person is still who's being angry? I don't know. Is it as if they have shit all over them even though it's justified? Do you see what I'm getting at? It's the quality of what happens not whether it's morally justified or not. In the. Future. I don't know. There's probably everyone in this room would get angry but perhaps something could be done. In other words the anger itself is maybe not as worthwhile as how you act in terms of that situation. And maybe the anger is even an impediment. It just adds this whole an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth psychology. And then you walk out into the street and you wonder why everyone is blind and has no teeth. I mean we're all doing it to each other. No that's for each one of us to decide. I'm not saying what to do. I'm not saying don't kill that person who's torturing a child or whatever. That's for you to decide. Actually even in spiritual literature it's not talked about very often because usually what is attempted is to cultivate the avoidance of these States. But it is suggested and I don't know that I've ever met anyone who's in this category but it's suggested that there are people like this where they're so free that they can be angry and even use violence or force. But it's Dharmic. In other words it's in the service of something that's correct. Or is they're not getting anything out of it? There's nothing in it for them. I just have never met anyone like that. I don't know. I'd like to just keep going. And there's no reason to accept this whole scheme. Maybe it's just another moral prison to kind of constrain us and keep us from being expressive. But what I'm interested in is for us moving through these five and then examining if they occurred today at all to us. And so what? And what do we do about it? Anger near will restlessness and worry. Another kind of pair where some of these words are self evident. There's really not much point in going into it a great deal. It's at all level physical and mental. We find ourselves squirming. And this posture is no good and that posture is no good. And I'll change this way and shifting everything around changing the blanket and folding it this way and then folding it that way and then sitting on the meditation cushion I'll try the bench and the bench is no good. Back to the cushion. Maybe if I put some padding under the cushion and kind of fidgety restless and worry. Often this concern about what will happen to us in the future somehow we did something wrong or something that we'll pay for it something's going to happen that's going to be very unpleasant. And when we look at many of these worries the ground out of which they come a thought the mind produces a thought. It imagines what's going to happen and then it starts worrying about it. Very often it doesn't happen. So minds do that do that a fair amount. And the question is as we're moving through this have your mind been doing any of that any worrying the restlessness? Has it been there with you? Another one using terminology that's a little quaint now sloth and Tarper. It's kind of laziness tiredness fuzziness a lack of real alert fresh quality of mind. Anyone know that one? Maybe it would be helpful to work with this one in particular. It's in a way an easier one because I think I can find something in probably all of our experience or most of our experience that's tangible that we can work with and understand. Use inquiry. Let's say you find that you've been a lot of time is going by and there's a laziness there's a fog. You're attempting to be aware of what's happening but there's no energy and you're looking forward to the Bell being wrong and the mind is not clearly in focus. And that's not a pleasant feeling because we're here on a meditation retreat and we're very invested in having a clear mind and then it becomes punitive. Why am I so lazy? Why am I tired? Why am I sleepy? And so what can be helpful is investigation. Now in all of these that have been mentioned what is suggested as the best medicine for them is really no medicine. It's bringing mindfulness to them and seeing them as they are seeing the desire seeing the anger and ill will et cetera learning how to do that learning how to see them as something that comes and goes. And that's one of the main meanings of insight of insight meditation. Now you see it and then it's gone. Now often that helps tremendously. Just being able to be mindful of it is a tremendous aid with these hindrances or obstacles. Sometimes it's very deep and very powerful with a long history of conditioning and some investigation is really called for. Some real looking into it. Let's say you find yourself lazy and dull. The mind is lazy and dull for a period of time. Why is that? Perhaps you didn't have enough sleep but you checked that and you find that you did have enough sleep. Did you have a question? Oh okay. So that's not why. Perhaps there's a tiredness or a boredom because there's fear. Very often that happens to people. We're kind of fear coming around the corner and we don't want to deal with it. So we suddenly become very sleepy and bored kind of try to squelch it suffocate it. But you listen to your mind carefully. No I don't think I'm doing that food. Of course I have this huge lunch and maybe all this verbal investigation is really superfluous. We know it while we're doing it. It happens. We know we're overeating and all the rest of it. But let me suggest one way and there are a few people that I've seen in my own case sometimes it's been very helpful work with this one and you can see changes come that are very helpful. And it comes out of understanding rather than Fiat. For example there are a lot of shoulds maybe one would be you shouldn't eat a lot of food. We should all be thin right now. I think that's coming in isn't it? Skinny is good. And we know it's being documented. All these illnesses that are caused and come as a result of overweight and et cetera. And now here's another one being added onto it. If you're a meditator not only problems about heart and circulation and all the rest of it but clear mind. You just are not going to have clear mind if you overeat. So something else that we have to attend to. So you decide to not overeat. Okay I'm going to just half my portions and only have an Apple and two nuts at night. But you're doing it because you've heard some things scientists say. Or perhaps it doesn't seem attractive to people or some authority has said that this is not good. Maybe a meditation teacher has said if you eat a lot your mind will be dull. And then of course you can't do insight meditation too. Well that's obvious. And so you follow the authority and that's where the energy is coming from to cut down on your eating. I don't see that goes very far. The momentum is it's coming from somewhere else. It's a reaction. It's an attempt to please someone else. But when the understanding of let's say this relationship between overeating and clarity of mind is your own that you kind of dig it out of your own body your own mind then it becomes an act of intelligence. It's very different. It has power and it's you doing it not because of something external to yourself. Let's see if we can move with that one in a fairly detailed way. If you keep doing these things insight meditation et cetera you may come to really appreciate clarity of mind calmness tranquility as it's just wonderful when the mind is there. Because what flows from it the actions that come from it are extraordinary too. They're more helpful in life. It just makes living a lot easier. So we come to value that. But we also like food. Those tastes tremendous. Conditioning around food the appearance of it the smell of it our childhood history of how satisfying it was how we've used it to compensate for all that isn't right in our life. Okay so we go through the line here at IMF and we can begin to learn. In a sense we have two joys. One is eating a lot of food seems to be satisfying. That's why we do it tastes good. But then also clear mind is good. Well which one do you want? Because if we have lots of good taste trips and suddenly we find ourselves double from 01:00 until 330 and having a hard time just staying in the meditation hall at all. And yet then we remember times that oh the mind was so clear. It was like a cool breeze and a hot summer night. So wonderful so refreshing. I want that state of mind and I can use it. The practice goes deeper. I learn so much more when my mind is that way. Oh but that food tastes so good. Try something when you move through the line. I'm not trying to say stamp out the pleasant taste but as you move through the line watch your mind and of course your body let's say something is being served that you really like. Perhaps an image will pop up in the mind or even the thought Ah lasagna. And it's a good feeling. Be with the feeling. If you're with the feeling it doesn't proliferate. It doesn't become a whole emotional fantasy conditioned encumbrance that surrounds it and then you're lost. Then in a sense you're eating a concept. You're not staying in the moment because you're having lasagna which has a whole universe almost around it for you if it does. And so it's possible to eat a meal where you're enjoying the taste. That isn't the problem. You're right there with each taste but you then hear what mind makes out of it in terms of memory wanting more of it fantasies mainly from the past. If you do that I think it's possible to learn to eat a meal and enjoy it. In other words it's not this aesthetic not allowing yourself to enjoy food. At any rate what you may find is that a lot of the pleasures that come from the food is not so much the food. There are examples from people that I know who've been eating tofu for quite a while because that's got all kinds of good things. It's low cholesterol et cetera and it's very in. Things Oriental are in now maybe almost on the way out but they're still in and they don't like tofu. And it took one person two to two and a half years and did a simple eating meditation and realized that didn't really like tofu but liked the concept and Orientalia and macrobiotic and all of that. Nothing wrong with that. It's just that our practice is to bring us into direct experience. I'm just giving some hints because what might come out of all this exploration is the possibility of enjoying eating for it not being a harsh austere grim journey enjoying it when you have it and yet not needing to take so much of it because we lose control. We get lost that we then destroy let's say the mental clarity that may or may not be important to you. If it becomes important to you then what I'm talking about makes sense. If it isn't then of course then it's not relevant. And this detailed kind of investigation is more. It's not limited to food. It means when these hindrances come up exploring them seeing what they're really about. But it has to be done in the moment as it happens and that takes path. It's not the doubt of inquiry. Skeptical doubt is more or the doubt of inquiry is healthy. It's looking at life and exploring it trying to understand skeptical doubt in a way undercuts the possibilities for us. It has to do with doubting ourselves. Mainly. We're not the kinds of people we hear all these wonderful things that are possible in spiritual development but not really for me at a deep level we don't really have that faith or that sense that it's that confidence. Doubt in the teachings doubt in the teacher. Maybe it's all doubtful. Maybe the teacher is a doubtful and the teaching is doubtful. And it's very healthy. Where I'd like to suggest for the life of the retreat while you're here it'd be very helpful to when the doubts come to observe them and see that the doubting mind is going into operation. I'm not saying that there aren't things that are not doubtful in life that clearly are but it can be very helpful training during a retreat to every time a doubt comes up to really just be with it. Then after the retreat it might be easier to really evaluate that and say Well I don't think that this Apostle is for me. I think it makes extravagant claims and all this and whatever it is you want to come to inclusion of. But central for us I feel is the self doubt because many of the people who've come here do have some confidence in the teaching. So he wouldn't have gone through all this trouble. And the teachers are reasonable. We're in some way like Western Union messengers just delivering it to the best of our ability. But the self doubt is crippling and it's very torturing if you really are beginning to walk on the path and having all kinds of conflicts and doubts and worries about it. Okay those are what are called the five hindrances. Roughly what might help us in talking to each other about it? Think if there was any one that was prominent during the day for you and you may not be able to do this now but maybe in the future tomorrow or later today what are the conditions perhaps that brought it about? Or is a certain thought a particular thought or an action much as like with a food example something happens. A particular morsel of food is in front of you. It produces an effect which can be registered in awareness. Does anything come to mind for anyone? Anyone learn anything? Are these relevant these terms are they relevant to us in the modern world? Yeah. Yes. The Buddha used a very interesting image for that. It sort of amounts to do you want to be hit by two darts or one other words the original Dart which hurts is what you were talking about. Let's say the discomfort in the body the feeling. It's an unpleasant feeling. The second Dart is the emotion that the mind cooks up about it the expectation this is never going to end et cetera. All the stories that come up it's possible to pick up on that. And one suggested way of working perhaps you're already on to that is bringing your attention to that discomfort period. And then seeing all that the mind does. How the mind collaborates and can make much of it can just blow it totally out of proportion particularly if you're not aware of it. Whereas if there's an uncoupling there's an insight into the difference between mind and body. And that's one of the first meanings of insight meditation is that insight into the difference between mind and body. You'll see that there's much that even the discomfort is less because the mind element has been seen through. Does that make any sense to you? I'm sorry. It's hard for me to see you. Thoughts are very powerful. Anyone else connect with these hindrances in some way during the day or even right now? Even better it's happening right now. Okay. When you go through them what is actually happening when you're not able to watch it? What does that feel like? Could you go into a bit more detail? Any conclusions about yourself? Self characterizations? Guess what I'm getting at is that one very important thing to look for in these when we work with them. Is there any identification? Let's say the mind is dull null energy et cetera. If you identify with that then I am dull. In other words we form a conclusion about ourselves or I am an angry person. And then of course it proliferates and you have a real problem. Rather than seeing it for what it is it's something that arises and passes away. Do you see what I'm getting at? So please be sensitive to that. Really when any of these hindrances come up see if you haven't caught onto it or it's identified with it and as a result formed a conclusion about yourself. You formed a self description. I'm a this or I'm a that. And a lot of trouble comes with that. Okay. How did you work with it when it came up? Were you able to or was it too much? Hey when you say getting a sense that it would pass does that mean kind of whistling in the dark sort of like greeting your teeth? Well I know it's going to leave in a little while. I'll just sit quietly and wait.

If there's real attention there's no identification. If there's an identification it really isn't the awareness that we're talking about. So that can be helpful sometimes. And that's why our practice in one sense is very simple to Mark. It's not easy but it's simple. It's learning how to really be with what is happening directly as it happens. Could you see any connections that has certain hindrances coming about because of being triggered by certain things? Now it's perhaps a little bit more on the agenda that is perhaps just our talking tonight about this will help us recognize them when they come up. There is a certain power in naming. I think eventually the practice becomes more powerful with no names but just what is just what's there. But for example just be able to say restlessness is here little name tag on it. It makes it a little easier to bring awareness to it. Tell you what helped me a lot with it is just in reading some of the old Buddhist books realizing my God 2500 years ago people going through this too. We're human beings.

Whatever word you want to use nothing personal. We all have the same mind and you recognize that. And you went to the breath which can help. They can give you some energy and wake you up. But what I would suggest is sometimes at least don't run from the unpleasant state of the sloth and torpor whatever we want to call it but bring the awareness to that itself. Don't be in too much of a hurry to go to the breath which is always there if you need it. But because a very important part of our practice is this ability to get comfortable with discomfort for it to be okay for Laziness to be here or to notice these States they come and go like natural events like the seasons and the weather to develop equanimity in the face of all these things. Whereas if we're still using some technique to get rid of it then we're not fully facing it becoming comfortable with it. Do you sense what I'm getting at? Yes I was thinking that myself but it was so nebulous I didn't know how to focus in on it. Okay. Allow the donors to really take effect. Okay. It's a strange one. I remember one time in being struggling with sleep and at a certain point remembering some of the same things that I've just said. Someone else said and remembering them at the time it was happening fortunately and I stopped struggling with the sleepiness and I just. I don't know where I was but I was in meditative on a Christian somewhere and I wound up being somewhat like this with the head dangling and lids heavy but really feeling all of it. And suddenly there was a real burst of energy and I was like absolutely totally 100% was not trying to be awake. I totally went with okay I'm sleepy and I was willing to just fall on the floor and just blow some Z's. I think I must have been alone. Yeah. You have to take certain risks in this meditation. When you went to the breath was there a bit more energy then when. I was doing anything else Besides sitting? I think that I'm accustomed to having something specific or concrete to focus on something negative. But somehow that's an easier experience for me than avoid. Yes we all have these different preferences. And what's being asked of us in this practice is that we learn how to bring awareness to whatever is there just because it's there. We don't need any other justification. It happens that your mind was just the way it was. There are no words for it. Nebulous vague. That's what's there. Can we even be with that problem. With it is Besides the state being a fog to look at. It was. Yes. Okay. At that point you have to do some more active things. Perhaps here. It's a little bit laid out for us. But do more brisk walking or arouse energy in some way.

Don't worry about us. If our peace is so dependent on each on you being a little angel then it's kind of a hothouse serenity that we're developing. That's our problem. We'll work with it. Or what is she doing? Or whatever it is that's up to us. Sometimes people get too formal and tight view of what a meditation setting is. Of course being reasonable it might be if you can do it go out to the woods or whatever. But if it should happen in the hall for any of us. So what? That's what we're here for. This is a garbage disposal area IMS. I'm a sanitation worker. That's what we're here for. I mean it's not necessarily what we're here for but a lot of what happens through this. Sitting and walking and sitting and walking and sitting walking. Things come up and it's okay. Anyone else have something wants to relate to this? Do I see a hand in the back? Yeah please. Sure. Right. What's the problem? Don't look for trouble. Supposing all those mental States disappear. You don't realize it but you're bragging. No. Sometimes it happens and sometimes not. Yes. With thought in particular. Very often as you start becoming aware of thought and the thought raises its little head and awareness is there. It never gets to finish itself. In fact many problems in meditation are not really solved. They're dissolved. Maybe we could finish up with. I'd like to use an image and a personal experience that I had along these lines. I think it links up with what you're saying. The image is just meant as an aid. Please don't take it literally. It comes from Alchemy. And what is attempted in Alchemy is to turn base metal into gold. That's the outer meaning of it. The inner meaning of course is that the base metal is these hindrances those aspects of ourselves that are preventing happiness and fulfillment for each one of us. And what is said in Alchemy is that through certain flame through fire and through a hermetically sealed container that is if those hindrances or let's say the base metal are put in a container that's sealed and can be burned with a flame there's a transformation that takes place and the base metal becomes gold which is to say the hindrances are in a sense they're burned away. And what you have in a way they're opposites. For example skeptical doubt becomes confidence but real confidence. And all the others anger and ill will becomes say love and compassion. Now in this image you have the base metal and you have a hermetically sealed container and you have a flame. In our practice awareness is like that flame. And if I could use the analogy a little bit let's say one of these hindrances come up. These are mental States that are uncomfortable. They're painful. We'd rather not have them but they are a large part of our life. And in the early stages of meditation. It's not that I skip this step. Everyone who's been sitting for a while knows what at the beginning of meditation almost. That's what you're doing. You're just cataloging endlessly. These hindrances parading back and forth with a few moments of Sunshine and light. The awareness is the flame. Let's say the hindrance is the base metal. And the equivalent to the sealed in container is the mine not running from the hindrance because when the container is sealed it means there's no leak. And so there's a power that that flame has. Awareness is like that flame. And when the mind can learn to face whatever comes up or is to face it just be with it no matter what it is. Now the ultimate test perhaps is death. Can we face death? It's eye to eye. That's what we're learning to do. We're learning how to extend this principle. We're starting with just our feet and the breath. But if you understand what's being said it's being suggested. It's spreading and being applied to our total entire life without exception. And what is being suggested is that out of the flame of awareness brings a transformation. And it's no wonder that perhaps you looked at those things and they fell away. How did it feel after they fell away? Was there a little clarity and space? And most of us have had so much conditioning around the value of thinking that if we get a patch of free space it's somehow not so valuable unless we can put a name on it. Okay let me finish tonight. And we can do more of this in the discussions tomorrow because you can explore them now a little bit more with an experience that I had that was very helpful for me very inspiring very powerful. It happened a couple of years ago. There was a group of about ten of us who are working with Krishna and Merti for about three or four days. And we would meet and have a discussion for three or 4 hours. Those of you I assume that many of you have read his work or heard him. To have a discussion with Krishnamuri means that for three or 4 hours for three or four days you find that no matter what you say is wrong there's nothing that so essentially you keep finding out that you don't understand what he's talking about. And we were on worry and fear. They were kind of taken together. And the four days was coming to an end. We had about 20 minutes left and people were then going to scatter and go to different parts of the country. And it was quite an intense three or four days. You worked very hard with a man like that. And suddenly he did something which seems like it seemed out of place like a non sequitur. He just started talking. He said the other day I went with some friends to a jeweler on Fifth Avenue. This was in New York. And we went into the shop and I was able to hold in my hands and then he kind of acted it out. This jewel that was worth I don't know some tremendous figure an extraordinarily valuable beautiful piece of jewelry he said. And I held it and I looked at it totally remember we were going around much like we've been doing tonight and you've been doing many of you for months bringing awareness to some of these States that we'd rather were not there. He said and I looked at this beautiful jewel and it was exquisite just the cut and the way light was reflected. And he was more articulate about it than I can be. Just went on and on about the beauty of this particular jewel and was looking at it and he said and then the intensity of my attention became so strong that the jewel disappeared into totality whatever that means for you. And then he was holding his hands this way if you can see as if he had the jewel in his hand. And then quickly we were all of course fixated on his hands and on this imaginary jewel. And then he quickly took the jewel away and he said Fear and worry are that jewel. He put it right there. And can you see the beauty of fear and worry? That is the tremendous energy that's locked up in let's say fear or worry or any of these hindrances. It's a jewel. He called it a jewel. He said. It's a real jewel because if you can bring this very gentle sustained attention to this fear it turns out that that energy that was locked up in it is released and is now available to us and can be used for all kinds of things. And it was a tremendous education because it used a beautiful metaphor of a jewel for an area that we usually don't think of as beautiful. And so it did a trip on my head on all of us in that room. When these hindrances come up they're not bad. They're what we have to work with. They're the way human beings are put together for some reason don't ask me. I didn't write this script. But when it comes up if we can have a more accepting positive attitude that is this is a positive challenge. An opportunity to learn and to free ourselves then none of these hindrances will ever be the same. Now to some degree that's not possible. Until our steadiness our concentration becomes a little stronger.

I feel that sometimes I can't tell when I'm coming back to the breath if I'm coming back to the breath that is breathing itself or if I'm creating that breath to come back to it. Well it sounds a little complicated. Sometimes I feel myself coming back to the breath but I'm not sure if it's a breath that I'm already in the middle of. Okay. What's important is air is going in through these nostrils and coming out feel that. Now if you are trying a lot that's going to upset the practice and you'll learn about it because you're controlling the breath and you'll start to feel that. And if that should come up then examine that bring awareness to that something extra that you're adding to the breath. But the key thing is I don't think you have to get as complicated as your question sounds at least to me is that the main thing is can you experience that contact between the air and your nostrils? And if you're getting it there through some kind of imposition you're going to begin to see that because that won't work. Not in the long run. Yes. One of the themes of maybe the theme of the week is how to care for the heart. Now when I use the term heart I'm using it. The polyword is Chitta. The word mind because of all is a little limited. It means it's right here pointing to my head to those who are in the back. And it's rather narrow. It's just sort of thinking and imagining and remembering and kind of that a limited view of it. Heart includes that or Chitta includes that. And it's vast. It's immense. At first. The mind for most of us is not an ally. No it's not reliable. And as I said it's throwing up all kinds of things that hurt us. These are what are called the Calaisas as the tendencies of greed hatred and delusion and all their offspring which in a sense are entangling the heart. The heart has a purity all its own. It's not that we have to have to import something so you could look at this practice as a massive detoxification. That is we have this pure heart that's got all these entanglements. And what we're doing is we're learning how to see through these entanglements. And from that point of view it's a struggle. On the one hand you have the Dharma and on the other hand you have the Calasis and they're struggling for your heart. For each one of us we're in the middle of that. A turn towards the Dharma is a decisive turn to it's saying I am tired of suffering unnecessarily and I want to find out why I'm doing it and I want to change. Now Buddha Dharma is one solution to it. It's one characterization of the dilemma of being a human being. And also it's kind of a map of a prison that we're all in. And it's also a map of how to escape from the prison. Now the map isn't perfect because it's just a map. So you have to really start digging to get out make that tunnel. I only see it in movies. I don't know if anyone ever really escaped that way. But of course it's the greatest friend that we have. But at this point you have to answer it for yourself. The unexamined heart is a big problem isn't it? That's what's ruling the world. The problem in the world right now is not nuclear weapons. It's the calacus the calacus in the collection of individuals known as planet Earth. I mean the gun doesn't shoot you. Some hand pulls the trigger but there's a mind behind the hand that pulls the trigger that's deranged in some way that's either being controlled by greed or hatred or delusion or unawareness which is in all of these things. And we all have that. Perhaps none of us in this room are killers and we wouldn't want to use nuclear weapons. And we eat vegetables and all kinds of nice things but nonetheless the calacas are here too. Jean Contadamo today when we were walking he was very curious. He saw how the rocks are piled up to make these fences. And so he was just trying to understand that's an old New England tradition isn't it? I mean they make good friends right? Fences make what we talked about what he saw he saw it in a more innocent way. I've just been seeing rocks. All of a sudden he saw how much time ever pile up all those rocks? This is my land and you're on my land. That's out there. That's yours. This is mine. What he saw it as the Kalases expressed through rocks eye and mine and all that comes out of that. So at this point that's what it's about. We're trying to be our own best friend. We all think everyone wants happiness. We all have our ways of trying to attain happiness. We're trying to put together those causes which produce happy endings. But without wisdom the causes don't produce happy endings and it also takes wisdom to even see that to even see that what you're doing is not working. People will go through a whole lifetime using ineffective ways of trying to gain happiness. Every time I visit my parents in Florida which is a lot of elderly retired people the most painful part is seeing how little how it's possible to the squabbles are the kinds of squabbles that go on in high school between elderly people who have lived for 80 years 75 years. They don't have quite as much energy so they can't do each other in as much but the calacus are still there. Ruthie said to me and she told me and uncle said okay so it's a matter of wising up and it's not going to happen unless we take our life into our own hands. Okay? Who's we that would be dualistic. In other words do I own the chip? Is what you're asking? I think the question wouldn't make much sense at a certain point you are the Chitta all the other things are encrustations. I don't think the question it's okay to ask the question. It's a good question. The best.", 'human_start_time': '0:54:20'}, {'talkname': '19880321-Larry_Rosenberg-UNK-reflection_on_samadhi-1547', 'question_num': 'Question 1', 'url': '/talks/1547/19880321-Larry_Rosenberg-UNK-reflection_on_samadhi-1547.mp3', 'display_name': 'Reflection On Samadhi', 'date': '3/21/88 0:00', 'start_time': 2510150, 'content': "When you're focusing on your back does that eventually mean that whatever sensation is in your desk are you supposed to be exploring having massive interest? Yes. Interest. You won't be able to hold onto it over and over again if you have no interest. So the interest will be there. But there's a different accent the interest in wisdom work and the interest in Somati work is somewhat different. We're not looking to see impermanence or the absence of selfhood in it but we are being very very careful and it's how we notice the breath. Now I may be wrong but I feel in back of your question it's hard to know until you've done it long enough is that it's not as if you keep paying attention to those same old boring in breaths and outreaths that you're watching the identical thing. Let's say ten years from now let's say you keep doing it for ten years with some breaks because what happens is the breath itself is such a rich universe it becomes quite subtle. Moreover the mind States that come out of it. You see the practice is really not about the breath. We're using the breath. And as I mentioned it could be anything else. We're using it to unify the mind. The important thing is for the mind to become unified. You may find that it's interesting enough once you get beyond a certain threshold when a certain degree of calm comes in and other things that accompany the settling down of the mind the process of Samadhi starting to take you may find that you can sit and follow the breath for hours and not be bored and not look for the other preoccupations that dominated your interest for years. Well no if it is monotonous if you're not with it and if you're not in the present yeah no we're trying to de hypnotize ourselves. We're already hypnotized. But monotony is a mental problem. You see it's something like this. You're saying the same breath coming in and out but it isn't the same breath. First of all it literally isn't as if you start to look. You'll see sometimes it's a little bit more coarse or a little bit more fine or shorter or longer or it's pleasant or unpleasant but in another way it's not the same. The monotony comes in because we're not very mindful. That is we're living from memory. So let's say you follow 20 breaths if you're not fully alert. The 20th breath is being measured with a backdrop of the 19 that went before. And so it's like oh yeah I've been doing this long enough. Now I'm tired. I've already seen 19 breaths and I don't want to get into 20 and then it'll be 25 breaths. But when you're in the moment each breath is fresh. It's just born anew and dies anew. The Samadhi practice has no future or past none whatsoever. You're just with that occurrence as it occurs period. Now that's what we're developing. We're more likely to fall into the former where we do have a context of memory and we're like wow I've been doing this for 45 minutes. It really is monotonous so that we make monotonous. Now that lesson applies to daily life as well. There is a potential in life for enormous tedium. If any of you noticed that maybe you have to be at least 20 years old to learn it. But then when it gets to be 30 or 40 when you get on there's a potential for enormous tedium. How many more times can we wash the dishes and then dirty them again or whatever it is that we do over and over and over and over and over again? Make the bed and unmake the bed. Make the bed. Unmake the bed. How many more rolls of toilet paper do we have to replenish? Then take the wrapping off it and then we all hate to pull that socket out. So we leave a little bit of toilet paper so that the next person will have to do it. Okay so we're living in memory a lot. But if we're very much more in the present then it's not seen as doing that same old thing over again. Because what we're doing is just what we're doing. You don't want to say what? Yes. If you can follow the breath for 1 hour we'll give you a certain amount of money. Or what is it that you want? Do you want a certificate at the end of it? You see. How do you get to that freshness? Good. You don't find the breath interesting? No. Okay. In the breath. But that's sinking. The freshness that I'm talking about is not an idea. Let's back off a bit. Let's just allow the word freshness to be. Let's assume we are talking about the same thing. One of the main ways in which Vipassana proceeds all aspects of our practice so many of them anyway is that you get to a particular quality through its opposite. That is we all want peace when we get there through examining restlessness we all want to be very compassionate. But in order to get there we have to look at our selfishness. You tell me what quality would you like? Our starting point is us as we are not an ideal. So the freshness I'm talking about actually comes about from the repeated examination of the breath or some other suitable object. And a large part of what is happening while we're learning how to do that is that we're experiencing it the way you are. It's not that there's something strange about you it's that yeah it's not exciting enough. And what's the big deal? And another in breath and another out breath and so forth. But it's by continuing to do that that you will experience the freshness. It's not that it has to be different or it has to have five heads or something of that sort. It's the same breath. But what's happening is that the knowing has changed. The quality of knowing has changed. And the quality of knowing changes by use. It becomes refined by practicing it. So I'm afraid supposedly he said okay drop the breath we'll give you something else. The same thing would happen because the problem isn't something else. It's the nature of the mind that's the problem or the awareness that we haven't refined sufficiently. Does that make sense? It's too intellectual what you're saying. I think what you ought to do is just do the practice and learn from the doing of it rather than trying to figure it all out ahead of time. It's not going to work. I mean I could make up another set of words but I think what will help? Keep it simple. Stick to the present. I know you all want to hear much more than that about the silence. Okay? Now if you get mired in that. Let's say you start getting more and more silent and then you start becoming more and more averse to speaking. That would be called emptiness sickness really because it's fine to go through that and to taste that. But then the next step. We also are human beings who must speak to each other must communicate. Now there are some whose Karma is to just be quiet to go into silence for the rest of their life. But that's probably not true for you. You're asking a question right now and you've asked questions before you came into an interview. It was rather lazy. Right. So I think you get something out of talking just yet anyway. So what I'm trying to say is that. What am I trying to say? We have to come full circle. It's not that we want to get so silent that we become disgusted with speaking. The silence is helpful in that it refines the speaking so that we can really learn how to talk and use that. It's a very beautiful human capacity to be able to communicate and for it to have its right place to refine it not to discard it. So this is on the way to that. It's the same with thinking. We've talked about thinking. It's not to get if it were possible some kind of a lobotomy. So we never think anymore. It's actually to establish a proper relationship to thought. So that for example have thoughts that are not so destructive or when they are destructive to be freer of them than we are to let them just come and go rather than grasp onto them and breathe life into them. Anything else about the yes. Okay. Now that's very good for the task that we've set for ourselves which is developing calm. But the other practice where you use mental notes Vipasana that's going to come back in and you will want good. That's what it's about. That's part of what it's about. Fine. If it's working that way that's good. We have time for one last comment or question. Yes but how would you avoid it? What can we do? What can you do about it? I don't know about more. There are many mental things that accompany the breath that many times people will describe their breath but what they're really describing is their mind. But what we're attending to is the raw sensations. And the mind will throw up things about the breath. It could be an image of it or coloration or what have you. We don't want to get into war with anything. It's a nonviolent practice. So what we do is we stay with the breath and let the light do what it's going to do. Just as let's say if you're following the breath and cars drive by we can't stop them. So with the breath and in the periphery we hear the cars or thoughts come through the mind. But the main thing is to stay home or stay at home with the breath. The breath is our home our anchor and the other will pass. Remember the power of the practice in its simplicity is the exclusivity of the object the fact that we're staying with this one object over and over and over again and the only way you can do that is to let go of all the enticements that the mind has. Either they're trying to draw you in or through being negative but we get caught. And the quality that's so valuable in Samadhi is the Unwaveringness in the face of any kind of conditions. And so all of these negative States in a sense all these things that interfere with what might be a perfect sitting in Samadhi practice Are the ways in which we train ourselves Because more and more you won't have to get sucked in and you can stay with the breath. For example your knee hurts probably at the beginning you just want to go to it all the time. Now it's not that we're denying it It's just that we're with the breath and the knee pops up and then an idea pops up and then a plan and a worry. Now the more you can stay with the breath what tends to happen is you develop that kind of mind that can remain firm in the face of whatever else is being demanded of you. Now wouldn't that be helpful in life? Not just forget about meditation or spiritual practice? Very often we're required to be competent on the conditions that are not ideal. If you have children or whatever the situation is whatever your job is wouldn't it be nice if the mind was so serviceable that independent whether it's a nice day or not a nice day or people like you or don't like you that the mind is able to have that steadfast quality it's a big help and in spiritual work it's a prerequisite it's necessary. Otherwise all the notions about wisdom et cetera are fanciful. They just don't go deep enough.

But sharing this work and this practice is also very important. I can't imagine a longterm practice that doesn't include other people either in this sort of setting or one that we can create for ourselves with increasing awareness in a world that is deliberately selfdestructing. Apparently the discouragement and the pain that one becomes aware of inevitably not just by looking at ourselves. But. I agree with what you're saying but don't Harden it into an absolute principle is my suggestion for the following reason. There's an enormous amount that could be learned by being alone. And I'll just give you two examples and then it's not either or. For example I spent some time in Japan and Korea In the Zen tradition. And when I was in Korea I visited two hermits Both living in the mountains very difficult to get to and were in their own way strangely well known. They were hermits but they were well known. They were they lived in caves and had very primitive utensils et cetera. And I spent the better part of a day with one and then longer a few days with another one I felt was just a neurotic. He was having such a hard time with people and with jobs and all the rest of it that it was good that he got out of everyone's hair and they out of his hair and that he went to his cave and he wasn't having such a great time. And I was relieved to get out of there. The other man didn't even know how old he was anymore and he didn't know how many years he had been there. And he just radiated this incredible joy and love and was so human and answered. I asked him all kinds of questions and it's something that he learned by spending a lot of time alone that was invaluable for me which is not to say that I should be alone. Another example much more humble. A couple of years ago I did a three month retreat here as a Yogi and all of the yogis were meeting together before the retreat started and talking to each other. And my intention was to stay in my room the whole time I mean to come out to eat of course and maybe take some walks which is what I did. And someone asked we started talking and I made that statement and the person with me couldn't understand that said why in the world would you want to spend three months all by yourself in a room and you're just puzzling? I said well what kinds of feelings would that bring up for you to do that? I said wow boredom loneliness fear. So I said exactly. Do you know what I mean? Okay. It doesn't mean you stay there then. See there's certain things that you learn by being cut off from support reassurance. You know what I mean? Could we have a moment of silence and just finish the retreat off with encouragement to all of us to keep doing this or whatever other congenial approach you're taking become a sane healthy human being.", 'human_start_time': '0:54:59'}, {'talkname': '20001011-Larry_Rosenberg-CIMC-pure_observation_a_discussion-8719', 'question_num': 'Question 1', 'url': '/talks/8719/20001011-Larry_Rosenberg-CIMC-pure_observation_a_discussion-8719.mp3', 'display_name': 'Pure Observation -- A Discussion', 'date': '10/11/00 19:30', 'start_time': 578210, 'content': "Yes. Okay so you're already beginning to see it now. It's the same with emotional pain. And of course our main problem is mental pain and liberation is primarily that. Finally the clear seeing is about clearly seeing. Answer the question who am I? And the answer is not in words I'm a this or I'm a that. I'm a man a woman an American or this. Those are conventional answers. They're relatively true. But it's clearly seeing into the nature of what this is this known as me or this self. As the seeing gets more clear the world our sense of what the world is what our life is changes and hopefully it changes for the better. I don't think people would be doing this for thousands of years if it didn't bring some improvement. Then again people have been at war for thousands of years too and they seem to think it's going to do something great. And there's always a new generation getting ready. See how wonderful it is? They're all excited ready to pick up guns and put on uniforms. No one seems to learn. So it's for you to find out. So you've already gotten some sense that it has some value. Okay. Now if you practice it like any other skill mindfulness can become like a flame. I mean that strong. And when it gets steady too kind of abiding sustained. When that quality of attention touches whatever it touches something happens. Pure awareness pure observation that is it has no objective other than the clear seeing that's its value has tremendous transformative power. It's not trying to change anything. It's like a flame is not trying to burn up anything. That's its nature. Mindfulness is an energy in other words very very subtle. The more you practice and refine it the more subtle it is. And when it touches things something happens to what it touches. In the Poly language one of the meanings of SATY or mindfulness is that which sets things right. It seems to have a beneficial effect. And as you apply it more and more you see that it seems like you already have some evidence. Is that so? Okay good. It depends on language. I don't know what you mean how you use mindfulness. Sometimes intuition has kind of an unusual sort of like something that comes to you now and then. Mindfulness is very ordinary. That's the beauty of it. Quite ordinary. I find that I come to knowing about something inside myself or outside because mindfulness is something that can be done all the time. Wash your hands. You can be aware you can be mindful that you can feel the water the temperature the hands rubbing you eat. So mindfulness is something you can practice and do when the mind gets quiet. And I'm speaking now from a Buddhist perspective and I hope it matches something like what you call intuition out of one of the things that we discover when the mind gets quiet. I think to begin with particularly in a community like Cambridge and environment where people have so much education and have read lots of books we tend to think that intelligence is rational and logical. It is that's one form of intelligence. There's another kind of intelligence that when the mind gets silent let's say when thinking becomes quiescent stops there's a knowing that all of us have access to. No one has gotten cheated here that enables you to know the body. And in fact the body start has an intelligence that can begin to go to work. If you stop thinking so much in that clarity of mind there's much more of a possibility of an adequate response. And knowing a kind of knowing and it is experienced somewhat like the way you're not thinking. And it's an access to the Tibetans have a way of putting it. They call it the cognizing power of emptiness. It's mysterious to me. I've been practicing for a while when the mind becomes still and empty in that sense it's like this room. We don't usually care about the space. We're focusing on the people the lighting and so forth. But there's space here. So the metaphor of space is often used of empty space. But the metaphor is limited because this empty space doesn't have cognizing power. It's just empty. When the mind becomes empty of thought it's like another kind of organic intelligence is released. And with meditation it can be not just intermittent it can be something that we have access to in a more steady way rather than now. And then we have a flash. We used to call it that. I don't know if people still call it that. So yes but mindfulness strictly speaking as I'm using it isn't exactly what you're saying but it opens up into it. Please I can't give you a guarantee or warranty or money back. We can give you. Yes. Very often people will come to meditation with a problem that they want to solve and that blocks them because they're so concerned with solving X that they don't develop the kind of mind that it can actually help them solve X more. Let's say I have an important decision to make and I gather something and I could feel it's important. Yeah. Step number one if I were doing it I would be aware of how invested I am in the outcome and then I might feel confused. Do you ever feel confused about it? Yes. Okay. The key in meditation it's an art. Can you learn how not to be confused by confusion? I don't know if that makes any sense. The mind is confused. Often when that happens we get hysterical and then we grope for some pseudo clarity. But from the point of view of a bigger picture of the mind confusion is just one mind state among many. It's just one visitor. It comes it goes. We're not always confused. Sometimes we're quite clear. Okay. So step number one is I'm just using myself. I would take a look at how confused I am and how much investment I have in getting that answer. Because to some degree that's blocking me I'll make it me instead of you if you try to figure it out often not always. Some things can be figured out. Some things have to be like technical problems. But I gather this is more than just information and technical. Yes. It's not how to assemble a vacuum cleaner or something. I understand. Okay. If you try to typically what we do is try to think it through and we may make lists. Like if I do this I get that but then I don't get that. And we have these long lists and then we get a headache. The attempt to solve the problem on that same level that the problem exists. This is from a meditative point of view. We're looking to the old mind to give us an answer. And it's exactly that mind that got us into the problem. I don't know if I'm making any sense. Meditation offers the possibility of help from someplace that is not the old mind which is sort of chasing your own tail going around and round and round. And so when the mind we're back to when the mind is clear. And how do you get clear? By let's say opening up to the confusion the different decisions. Hearing the mind is like a civil war. Can be going on inside the mind. If you can sit if the breathing helps you fine. I'm now applying insight meditation to it. Very often these problems are solved not on a timetable. When the mind gets clear suddenly the answer is very clear. But let's say you don't have the luxury of doing that. You've got to decide by 09:00 tomorrow morning. I'm making something up. Okay. So we can adapt the method. It has been done. I've done it. Others have done it. So let's say I have this struggle going on. If should I do X or Y? And they're fighting with each other. We're in conflict and there's confusion. I would relax soften to the Civil war. At that point there's no more civil war. There's only a civil war because X is in center stage of the mind and we're identified with X. Then Y comes along and is trying to edge it out and say no that's the wrong decision. This is the right decision. Then there's struggle and use of energy. What if you don't join sides but you just allow the civil war to rage? Let the mind say what it has to say now that itself is an art to not intervene at all. Just relax. The breathing can help stabilize you and listen to how the mind is. First X then Y then back and forth. And maybe there's confusion and maybe there's fear. Oh my God. If I make the wrong decision my whole life will be affected. Then you look at the fear. It isn't just a rational logical because we can all do that right now. We don't need meditation. So you want something from a deeper more significant level that is not irrational but it's deeper than rational. The degree to which the mind gets clearer you have a much better chance of seeing what really needs to be done. Here's something that when people hear this especially Americans it drives them crazy. And maybe you'll want to leave after you hear it. The clearer the mind gets the fewer the choices you have. And Americans love choices. We want to have a mall with 10000 flavors of ice cream. It's not just Americans now. It's the modern world. That sounds like imprisonment. What do you mean I have fewer choices? This is the land of opportunity. I want to have lots of choices. What I'm trying to say is when the mind is clear it's so obvious what you don't want that you actually have fewer choices because you're not wasting your time. And all kinds of things that are petty trivial irrelevant forms of old conditioning that maybe worked when you were in the fourth grade but they don't work anymore. And as the mind is quiet it can see here's. This may sound irrelevant. Someone after an enlightenment experience was asked this is an ancient China. What happened? And he said what did you learn from awakening? He said I learned that the grass is green and that the sky is blue. Like oh come on give me a break. I already know that. But do we really? So when the mind is clear whatever it is that's raging inside of you if you can let it tell its story without trying to make it have an outcome that you're not sure you know which the outcome is anyway. In other words the confusion can take you to clarity. If you have the stomach to put up with it. Let me give you a concrete example of this. I used to teach at a University and in the senior year people would meet with their advisor. Everyone would have one academic advisor. There were large lines of people who didn't know what they wanted to do. It's getting close to graduation and parents were getting upset. And if you go to law school I'll buy you a car. If you become a hippie or disowned whatever this is the so people would come and they were confused and I would give them basically the same advice even though it was a little because I was beginning to learn these things. I would say be with your confusion saying I don't know what to do. I say hey be with that. Let it see where that goes. And by about a month before graduation was amazing. How many people. Oh yeah. No I know what I'm going to do. Law social work. I'm going to be a teacher. Oh everything just worked this way out. Oh yeah absolutely. I'm totally clear. Very few people have the strength. Some could say I don't know and even graduate not knowing and saying I'm going to live with this one until it becomes clear most people couldn't bear it and they just made up anything. Yes I will get married. No I won't get married. Yes I will go to law school. I hate law school but nothing personal. And it's just that these are the kinds of things that you see what I'm getting at. So meditation approach to conflict. A problem is soft without the value of it is not being so in a hurry to get the answer. And in a sense letting the question the answer is in the question. Usually if you can just let the question really express itself. It sounds a little mystical and poetic but it does work. It makes some sense a little bit. Okay good. Please. I think you're going to have to ask Norie on that because I don't use that term. I can make a guess but it's what I was saying. Real mindfulness is non conceptual. It happens in the present tense. It's non judgmental et cetera. I don't know if she means by wise mindfulness that now in the teachings mindfulness leads to wisdom whereas clear seeing is what takes you to wisdom. And often they're inseparable. Really. Clear seeing is wisdom. It's not like now I see clearly except when we talk we have to make it like this leads to that. You see clearly and then this will lead to wisdom. In clear seeing the seeing is the wisdom. But I honestly don't know how Norize using that term. And I don't want to muddy up the water here.", 'human_start_time': '0:09:38'}, {'talkname': '20001011-Larry_Rosenberg-CIMC-pure_observation_a_discussion-8719', 'question_num': 'Question 2', 'url': '/talks/8719/20001011-Larry_Rosenberg-CIMC-pure_observation_a_discussion-8719.mp3', 'display_name': 'Pure Observation -- A Discussion', 'date': '10/11/00 19:30', 'start_time': 1642330, 'content': "Not going to a place that connects you to something else. That may be awesome. I'm not sure of your question. Like what? No one say no one saying don't think. Yes but do you have that problem that your mind is so mindful that you don't think anymore. I don't want to put on mindfulness down. It's your choice. But maybe this will help. No one's mindful all the time. I asked Krishna Murdy who was my first teacher who was a world esteemed teacher and I asked him that. He said of course not worried about being too mindful. I don't think it's any of our problem being too mindful. But what might be a problem see is if you have an agenda where what's hanging over your head is to be perfectly mindful to not miss one breath one step one morsel of food. You'd be exhausted by 09:00 in the morning. It's something that grows and flows more. It's more of a natural entering into life and being sensitive to what's happening to you. So you have to be patient. If you cultivate it if you practice it it starts to grow like anything else. It develops and it becomes more a way of life. It really at first seems like a technique. And of course you have to start with it as a technique but so many things start that way. Dance music sport. After a while it's not so much of a technique as a way of living where you really enjoy and value being awake. In this moment you understand that when you're awake you're more alive. Now I'm not going to say never be unmindful. I'm going to leave that up to you. I don't want to do that. But maybe you are carrying around the burden of trying too hard to be mindful all the time. And so no. Okay if you're doing the dishes mindful you're not thinking about the dishes. You're just doing the dishes. Now there's a role for thinking. This is a common misunderstanding because we're so entrenched in thinking. We've given so much authority to thinking. We've equated it with living. Many of us maybe all of us in this room we get paid to think. And some of us have gotten Fame and power and prestige and lots of money and a nice place to live because we're good at thinking and we're encouraged and we have books and so forth. And then this comes around and saying there's another quality that's quite useful and that's thought free wakefulness thought free wakefulness. No one's saying to stamp out thinking but to begin with because it's so top heavy in terms of thinking we have to make fun of thinking give you thoughts about thinking that show that it's limited. It is limited which is not to say that it's not valuable. But the point is balance. There's nothing wrong with thought is that our relationship to thought is overdone. It's obsessed and to the point where other aspects of being alive are neglected. So thinking it has its own beauty. You see that implies that you have so much non thinking that I got to set aside. I never think anymore. I've got to set aside some time where I think. And when you get to that place you take over and I'll sit where you are. Sure you don't want to miss out on any great thought? Go ahead. I'm sorry. Yeah. Don't answer the door. Don't wash it. This is just run to your cushion. Sit in full Lotus and meditate. If you make anything an absolute it does become absurd. I'm being absurd. Now if I were to say no thinking under no conditions or each thing must be done exactly at its time. Let's say a parent is getting a meal ready. And they're totally washing the vegetables cutting the vegetables. Suddenly a child crawls into the room bleeding. What would you do? Of course you drop the dishes and you enter wholeheartedly to the child. You pay attention to the child. Now the thing. It sounds very academic. Well. But in the process I might have a great thought about the nature of the universe. Or I don't know what thought it is. Maybe. But see life settles at force. You know what the priority is? Usually life. Each situation has its own intelligence built into it. And if you pay attention you'll know what's called for here? Picking up your child examining the wound and doing what's necessary. That's correct action. Okay. Now here's what I'm getting at. Let's say the instructions on meditation are to sit and follow your breathing. And then sometimes we open it up and you see what's coming and going. And then suddenly you have a tremendous inspiration. Let's say you do computer work right? I know you do. And suddenly there's a whole breakthrough in some program. You've been struggling. I don't know. I'm making something up. Okay. I could solve this and possibly even win a Nobel Prize. But I can't do it because Larry said that. The Buddhist said that. Krishnamurdi said that we have to pay attention. Sometimes you pull over to the side of the road and forget about what Larry said or the Buddhist said and you enter into it. But I can't make that into a rule or a principle. It's something that life dictates. It's something spontaneous. But if you find that you're pulling over to the side of Earth every five minutes then you know that's just we know how to do that. First of all we've all done lots of thinking including great thoughts trivial thoughts. Are you happy with where it's taken you? Let's say that's the exclusive endeavor if you are full speed ahead. But for most of us it hasn't. But it's not to throw it out because it has its own beauty. It's more to allow something else. Another capacity that we human beings have. We don't even know we have it. We haven't been educated to know that there is another kind of let's say intelligence. This knowing is a human capacity that's invaluable. It doesn't have to mean that we stop thinking or throw thought out. And so I can't give you a rule book. It's not a computer program. We're human. We're not computers. Maybe someday computers will prove me wrong. They'll be so human. They'll be more human than I don't know what but you see what I'm getting at. So there's room for surprises. There's room for dropping what you're doing. If you pay attention you know what to do. But even when you think being awake is very helpful I mean the thinking is clearer.

But I could feel like with a different it's like everything stopped and I was really there. But really so much of the time I'm thinking it's like I'm making something up all the time. And I feel like I'm so separated from my real experience I don't think I ever realized exactly how far away I am. Because it's like in my mind of creating something of making something instead of really. Yes. What's the question? I guess just how to have this kind of experience happen more often. I did a sweat Lodge many years ago. My memory of it was quite useful and valuable. But it's a dramatic thing that you do. It's not something you do all day long obviously. Right. You could try it but I don't think it'll work out too well. For example even in Dharma circles there are things to shock the mind. That's another approach. A teacher might scream at you. Life does it. Suddenly someone dies unexpectedly and the shock wakes you up to something that takes you to a much deeper level. But then you fall back. And with your sweat that state you had probably isn't here right now. Okay so this can make it more ordinary again. I don't mean to be exactly the way it was in the sweat Lodge. So that there's a quality of sensitivity and wakefulness and intimacy with your experience that's more a normal part of your life that isn't so special. That only happens either by accident. It just comes uninvited. Some of the most beautiful things do come invited. I don't think that you can make enlightenment happen. I think you can lay the groundwork like you can open up the windows. But whether the breeze comes in or not whether you say that's mystical I feel it's out of my hands. It's out of all of our hands. But as an ongoing way of life the practice of bringing awareness into what you're doing is something that little by little can just become a normal part of just being alive. So that ordinary things are just experienced. They're so much more fulfilling. Let me give you an example. Some years ago we have practice groups here and someone who was a Cook a professional Cook about the 7th or 8th week of our came in very excited and said this morning I finally understand what everyone's been talking about all these books and the Buddha and et cetera. Well what happened? I was chopping broccoli. I remember the vegetable. Okay. I was chopping broccoli and suddenly it was the most beautiful activity in the world. I was just totally clear. My mind was not ahead of the broccoli or behind the broccoli. It was just receiving life in the form of broccoli and cutting. And you could see the person was full of tears. Suddenly they felt so alive. Now does that mean we all run out and get by broccoli and start chopping it? It's not in the broccoli. Finally it has nothing to do with broccoli. It has to do with the quality of mind that was brought to something rather ordinary. And that's what the sky is blue the grass is green. Sometimes there are dramatic things that happen in meditation quite dramatic what we call breakthroughs. I'm not denying that. But the practice is not like you practice now. So that in 25 years you'll be really clear. It's that in each moment. This is my understanding of the Buddhist teaching the essence of it. In each moment we're either enslaved or free. When we're all caught up identified attached or averse to what we're doing lost in what we're doing we're enslaved in a breath or in a moment when we see what's going on. And suddenly there's a clarity and an awakening in that moment. Suddenly it's a moment of freedom. So the practice of freedom is something that's ongoing moment to moment. And then of course there are big freedoms you could say but these small freedoms are what our life is made up of. And these small slaveries is what our life is made up of. And as you do it like anything else it becomes more natural to do it. And you wonder why did I ever live any other way? So it's not to not do a sweat Lodge but I think do a sweat Lodge do all kinds of things. But what we're saying is bring this quality of attention. There's no place where it can't be useful for you. Am I making any sense? Yeah. If you're yawning pay attention to the fact that relief is in sight.", 'human_start_time': '0:36:10'}, {'talkname': '20001011-Larry_Rosenberg-CIMC-pure_observation_a_discussion-8719', 'question_num': 'Question 4', 'url': '/talks/8719/20001011-Larry_Rosenberg-CIMC-pure_observation_a_discussion-8719.mp3', 'display_name': 'Pure Observation -- A Discussion', 'date': '10/11/00 19:30', 'start_time': 2516890, 'content': "I may have missed something but there was always talking about thinking versus being mindful. And people seem to be speaking as. If they could suspend and be mindful. My experience and at times I am painful is that sometimes thought comes and then you're mindful of the thought. It isn't an either or proposition. If it were that might be nice. Exactly the point of for example if you like try this on your own time begin your sitting with a breath or metal or whatever calm your mind down. And just from time to time just sit and listen to thinking. Now at first you find it very difficult. Most people do. It's often called a train of thought. Stay on the platform. But typically what will happen is you get on the train and then two steps down and then you realize that Central Square is down that way and you're Park Street. But little by little don't get discouraged. The thing with thought is that it's a very subtle object. But in principle you can be mindful of thought or pain in the body or the sound of a bird. It's not only subtle but because we've had so much conditioning with it. It's so charged that it casts a spell on us. And before we know it the power that thought has. We've given thought that power in and of itself. A thought is just a thought. And think about that one or reflect on it. Did you know that if you leave here tonight and forget everything don't forget that one. A thought is a thought. Did you know that? That's what it is. Okay now if you don't know that the thought comes up. I'm an awful horrible person who will never be able to get anything done. You identify with it. Energy comes into it. If you make I'm an awful person you have. I'm an awful person. Okay if you don't. It's a thought. It's like skyriding. Eat Garlic's milk drink Garlic's milk. It just comes by and we're not that interested. I don't know why he's wasting money with that. I'm not going to buy that milk anyway because I eat soy milk. Because I live in Cambridge. We all have soy milk. So sure you're right. Please. No it's the non judging has to do with the seeing. Now the seeing can be while you're sitting. It can be directed at the breath or bodily feelings or a mood or anything really. But you can also bring this quality of awareness into action. It's not limited to a cushion because most of the icons in the Buddhist tradition almost all of them are the Buddha sitting sometimes standing or walking and sometimes lying down just before death. You don't see the Buddha vacuuming or whatever but you can develop the art of observation really anywhere at any time. And it's in that theme that I was referring to. What I was referring to is let's say here's a mirror. I'll do it differently. Here's a mirror. You put the face of Otto Fitler there. It's just going to reflect Otto Fitler. Take it away. There's no more Otto Fitler. There's no residue. You put Mother Teresa. It just sees Mother Teresa. You take that away. Do you see what I'm getting at now? What we're so concerned with results and outcomes and getting somewhere. I've got to get from A to B that we never are in A. So the art of practice is can you be where you already are? It turns out to be a high art. Usually very often we don't want what we have and we do want what we don't have. What if you could switch that around even a little bit. To want what you have and to not want what you don't have you would have a much happier life. I'm convinced of it. Don't make that an absolute okay. In other words let's say when naturalists who love nature look at nature for us you're not a naturalist. Let's say you really look at a sunset and it's really beautiful. I've seen some beautiful ones. We all have. And the beauty is such that it quiets the thinking mind without even trying to. Beauty can do that. That's one of its beauties. It's sort of like the thinking mind goes into abeyance and it's just pure sunset and we're with it and we're able to see that there's affection in it. It doesn't mean that it's like cold. It's not detached looking with binoculars at the sunset. It's what you are getting at. It's opening up to the sunset so that in real seeing as it ripens. Some of you may be new to this practice as you do it more. It's the whole being is seeing. It's not just your eyes the whole being is seeing. And that kind of clear seeing. It has elements of what a scientist does. I mean if scientists observed with some bias what kind of science would come out of that? So there's always an attempt to forever purify our ability to see clearly in science. And I think scientists who love their work they also have affection when they bring it to the materials that they're interested in. In fact if we went around the room I'm pretty sure that everyone here has a very high quality of seeing in some realm for one person might be photography another person that might be cooking another person that might be surgery whatever. But what's asked in meditation is can you take that quality of real interest and clear seeing? But now what you're looking at is numero Uno and that gets harder.", 'human_start_time': '0:41:56'}, {'talkname': '20001011-Larry_Rosenberg-CIMC-pure_observation_a_discussion-8719', 'question_num': 'Question 5', 'url': '/talks/8719/20001011-Larry_Rosenberg-CIMC-pure_observation_a_discussion-8719.mp3', 'display_name': 'Pure Observation -- A Discussion', 'date': '10/11/00 19:30', 'start_time': 2941010, 'content': "Question is that the idea of my TV is not really responsible for all the feelings that companies come look at it and have it be clear and then be able to act on knowing what those feelings are. You're going in the right direction. But see it's still very rational and logical. But it's somewhat like that. It's the difference between a response and a reaction. Let's say you insult me right now. I have had enough of this stupid talky voice and then if I'm reacting it just comes out of my conditioning. Oh yeah? Well who asked you to come? An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. Have you heard that? Then we wonder how come everyone is toothless and blind. I don't understand it. Well because we're reacting. You give me a left hook I give you a right to the jaw. Then you kick me and I hit you over there with a club. I wonder why we don't have peace and harmony because we don't want it. Okay. Now let's say you insult me and it hits and I feel it and I'm aware of that. It's not denial or pushing it away. It hits the target. But instead of just lashing out this is not the only way. But it's one thing that might clarify what you're asking. Instead you feel the hurt and you're with it. It tends to thin out or even disappear. If you're able to be with it then there's some space and there's a possibility of an adequate response. Rather reaction is mechanical your conditioning versus my conditioning. And what we think is spontaneous is often it's just conditioning expressing. We're very proud of it. A lot of it is just mechanical. It's been poured into our brain by the particular culture we live in and so forth. Okay. Is there anything fresh that a human being can come to that isn't seen through yesterday's eyes? And the answer of the Buddhist teaching is definitely so it's something like that. If you remember the difference between a reaction which is mechanical and you have no control and a response when the mind is clear then you don't know what's going to come out of that clarity. It's back to the confusion. But personally the best friend you have in the world is clear seeing because we don't know what's going to come up in life. Life is full of uncertainty and surprises disappointments good things. It's uncertain. Have you all noticed that? That life is uncertain? So what would be good is if we have this ability to see what's going on in a changing world to us. What's happening to us? Yes. Please love your mean thought. I love the child within. Yes. Well you don't cultivate the affection. What I was talking about is just part of being human. There's something beautiful in seeing and in learning. Okay. So no you don't hold yourself apart. There's something beautiful in life and every expression of it. Yes. When that happens the interest in practice first of all the word practice becomes irrelevant. You're not practicing anymore. You're living. And that kind of motivation when you really are interested in seeing your own experience and learning how you live how you actually live. And it's not limited to the cushion. That's more powerful than all the techniques put together. But the techniques are very helpful. So yes but it's not too now I'll try to be affectionate to my mean thoughts. Mean thoughts. Come in. Okay let me put it this way. I'm speaking from my own practice. If you begin to love clear seeing to love it the way you might love other things. Now it's not always that what comes in front of you is what you want to be there. Let's say someone dear to you dies. And I have a vivid memory of this. When my father died we're very close. It was very painful. I took his Ashes and I put them in the Atlantic Ocean. The pain was quite there and I was fully present. I thought I had been before because I'd been practicing with the grief before. But this one time I think I had it closer to what I'm trying to say. It was no separation between myself and the pain of loss. But here's the part that I'm trying to get at. There's a certain kind of fulfillment that I remember to this moment that was there because I was doing the best thing I could be doing for myself under these conditions. Somebody really died who I love. I really felt the pain. There was no pushing away. There was no trying to explain it. There was no getting lost in it. It was intimate receiving it and fully receiving it. But being as clear as I could be and just. This is what it's like. It's not thinking oh this is like a scientist with a little. This is what it's like when one loses someone that one loves. Put that down. It's not like that at all. There isn't anything better I could be doing than at that moment for myself even just selfishly than fully receiving the pain was there. It's not like I put it there. The death was there. In other words I was with the world as it really was facts rather than blah blah as to how I wanted it. And prior to that I thought I had been doing some pretty good greeting as well meaning open not running away. But I had little things. I was adding to it. And this one time I didn't. And there was a certain fulfillment in it. Now it's not that I want someone else who I love to die so I can get that back again. That's what happened. And that was my best way that I know of being alive in that situation. Does that make any sense really? Because you look a little. I knew there was an acceptance. I wasn't trying to be nice to myself. I was just fully attentive to what the actuality of that moment was which was pain because someone I love died. It wasn't contrived. I think I read the pastna book. None of that. But of course I've been practicing for a while. Tell me what you just said again. Go over that again. I'm not sure I got it.", 'human_start_time': '0:49:01'}, {'talkname': '20001011-Larry_Rosenberg-CIMC-pure_observation_a_discussion-8719', 'question_num': 'Question 6', 'url': '/talks/8719/20001011-Larry_Rosenberg-CIMC-pure_observation_a_discussion-8719.mp3', 'display_name': 'Pure Observation -- A Discussion', 'date': '10/11/00 19:30', 'start_time': 3412690, 'content': "Died. I felt very alive with feeling. Okay suppose someone dies and you feel happy they died. There was some awful rotten person who was mean to you and cruel then you would be with that. It's not that you're supposed to love. The training isn't being honest but that's what the practice is. Well if you do that then see that. But right tonight we're mainly talking about seeing observation mindfulness. So whatever it is that you're going to say how to be mindful of that is to be mindful. It's being honest. It's training and being mindful of how it is for you in that moment. There's not a particular way it's supposed to be except clear. Now see if I can help us out of this one. Prior other moments of let's say grieving because my father had died a month earlier and I just kept his Ashes for a while. I also thought I was doing the practice correctly but there were always little pieces of self pity or other kinds of trips that my mind was doing about that. This one time was just pure intimate no separation. Seeing it was painful. But I'm not saying I was ecstatic. What I was saying is there's a certain kind of fulfillment in fully is a dignity. You could even call it dignity in honoring my father's loss and my pain. And I have no ideas in it. It was not cultivated trained. I read to the Hospice trained. It had nothing to do with that. That's all useful too. But finally our practice is naive innocent open raw clear seeing fresh all the time. We're learning how to do that. It's not something that comes like anything else worthwhile. It takes some practice. Does that come a little closer? Okay last jump on it. But what if you do judge it? Then you'd see judging. What do you mean? Why do you have to step back? Just receive it. It's there. What's the stepping back for me? Yes. But as you practice more and more you'd be able to see the judging mind. Okay I'm going to leave you with this because it's time for us to stop. But probably you want to hear the President not the vice President and the two aspiring presidential candidates. I think they're much more fun tonight. Gore will try to be a party animal and Bush will try to be a very substantial foreign policy. Heavy duty. Whatever. Genius. Okay let me leave you with this idea. I'm not going to go into it very deeply. But your question the way you put it and it's a very important development in our practice. When we hear things like you read the instructions or some teacher says Be mindful of what's happening to you. Okay. Sounds straightforward. And we try to do that to begin with especially as you keep doing it. You'll probably see that when you think you're being mindful of what's happening your psyche is getting mixed in with it a lot. This is a beginner. All of your likes and dislikes and anxieties and apprehended in there. Your psychology is coloring the scene with practice. You start to see that and then it purifies. The seeing starts to there's less and less of your psyche in a sense polluting the perception. So then let's say it becomes oh this is what they mean by a clear mirror. But there's still a self consciousness of someone who's being aware of what's happening. Now that self consciousness Withers away with time. And when you hear things like observing without an observer that's what that means. There isn't a self conscious meditator who's being mindful to begin with of course there has to be which we're learning a new skill and we are self conscious. Am I doing it right et cetera? It's like learning anything new. But as you start practicing not only does our psyche have less and less of an influence in the perception but at a certain point this separation falls away. And that's real clear singing singing. You can't force that. That's something that grows out of practice. And we're back where we started because that's the clear mind where there's no separation. That's the intimacy because at that moment there's not a self conscious me that's looking at what's happening now to begin with I think that many if not most of us do detach especially from things that are frightening and unpleasant. So I don't disagree with what you're saying. But finally it's not about detaching. It's not about pulling back and looking at it. Although to begin with maybe that's the only way we can begin. When we look at fear we don't want to go in close to fear because we're afraid of it. But little by little we understand that real seeing is eye to eye eyeball and even that makes it sound like two things. But it's more if you want to get to know someone that's just taking analogy a person don't you have to get close to them? You have to see them talk to them listen to them et cetera. It's the same with self knowing it's. You getting close to yourself. So at a certain point it's not detachment it's nonattachment which is all the difference in the world. In nonattachment you're receiving what's happening you're letting it in and you're receiving it but you're not for or against it. You're experiencing it as it is. And then if you start to judge it where you are for or against it then you can see that too. And that becomes the next moment of mindfulness. And then little by little that's where the liberation comes from being able to do that. Real meditation begins with the death of the meditator right now. And I say this with respect because we have no choice. But right now the meditator is dressed up. The ego is camouflaged as a big meditator. It's the same ego that wanted to make a fortune sleep with everyone whatever it is your ego has wanted once and so forth. And now that maybe it's done enough of that I made a million. I slept with everyone. I've been all around the world. What spiritual? I'm not a spiritual person. I hear it's very important especially in Cambridge. I better try to be spiritual and eat organic food too. And so it becomes new. The ego doesn't care whatever you want. It's so brilliant it'll give it to you. You want to be selfless great let me do it. I'll be the most selfless person in the room. But it's the same game. You can't force it. So the meditator is that self consciousness. It's still a me that wants to meditate properly do it right. Get an outcome get a result. And how can you avoid that? I mean that's where we have to begin. And then little by little you get on to yourself. And that part starts getting weaker and weaker. And what's left is thought free wakefulness. Thought free wakefulness. And it's real clear seeing now don't hanker after what you think is observation without an observer. Because that attempt to do it is also part of the same thing. It's going to be again. Oh you want to just be an observer. You just want seeing without a seer. I'll do that too. Whatever you want. The ego is very amenable to anything as long as it remains supreme. Okay. Thank you for your patience. Sorry I don't know how Narayana is using wise mindfulness. I mean I could guess but that's silly because I could be wrong and you could ask her. Ok. We have just a moment of silence. May all beings be happy. May all beings be peaceful. And may all beings be free from suffering.com. Okay.

So I don't know what to do with it. I sometimes say this is just my call on. Yes that's true. I'm not quite sure how to work with that. That's what I was getting at. In other words as the journey has moved through manual labor from monks doing nothing to monks chopping wood drawing water drinking tea et cetera. Now what you're saying that's exactly our challenge. Well put. You have an archive of experience so you have a lot of conclusions about yourself in regard to this person and who this person is. So when you meet you might be trying to be nice trying to be tolerant trying to be sensitive trying to soften all that. That's all an impersonation. Do you see what I'm getting? Yeah. Now that's part of being socially polite and so forth. Now maybe some of that is necessary. If we all told each other exactly what's our mind the world would probably look worse than it is already. But what I'm suggesting the practice would be throw away all of your accumulated but it's not push them away is that when they come up see them just as you can experience an inbreath and an outbreath or when you're doing walking meditation you feel the foot touch and you experience or any other familiar expression. I know you've been practicing for a while. This in principle is no different. It's just much more subtle. And we have had no encouragement or very little or experience. We have a lot of experience being dominated by our past because the past has immense authority over us and it tells us how to be. And we think we're being spontaneous. But I think you're beginning to see or not. You can't help it right? Okay. So in this approach you always start where you are. And where you are is exactly what you describe. If you can at least temporarily lay down any ideals of how you should be or how you'd like to be. Or wouldn't it be nice if I were? Then you'd be I don't know good girl good Buddhist good friend good sister good whatever it is. And it doesn't mean you have to blab about it all the time. But while you're in so every time you meet this person they can teach you much more than the Buddha can because they're pushing buttons. Right. And some of those buttons are engraved. The path of self knowing is you're always beginning with yourself as you are now to make it a little bit more give it some texture. In real life let's say I'm you and you're the person and I have a problem with you. I don't. Okay. We don't know each other well enough too. We get to know each other. Then you'll be telling someone else about me. Okay. So let's say I'm attending to you because you're speaking. We're having lunch together or doing something together. We're old friends. And yet I have this. And while I'm attending to you with practice it's a skill that can be developed. If you practice it you don't lose touch with your reactivity. So I'm attending to you but I'm still in touch with what your presence brings up in me. You say something the same old I don't know. Obama's not that great. And you're an Obama man. He said well you're entitled to your point of view but you don't really mean it. Do you see what I'm getting at now? Sometimes like the tide going in and out. Sometimes I'm mainly with you but I haven't lost touch with myself. Sometimes let's say I have a strong reaction. I'm mainly in touch with that but I haven't lost touch with you. Now. Sometimes of course it's a new skill. It'll break down and you'll just fall into the same old thing. And then maybe the mind will be discouraged. Oh this is so hard to do. I can't do this. Then you watch. That discouragement. See this approach to practice is so simple minded that everyone sitting here. You're far too intelligent for these instructions. That's the problem. Our job is to dumb ourselves down. This is the pasta for Dummies. Aren't there a whole series of books? If I was more enterprising I could write one but I'm lazy. Meeting your friend as if for the first time now all of the recordings from the past is not like you now become an amnesiac or prefrontal lobotomy patient. Not at all. It's all there. But it starts losing its potency and it does not by trying to weaken it but by seeing. It awareness mindfulness whatever language you like is an energy and it has tremendous power. Seeing energy. Let's say in that moment you suddenly see that you have a conclusion about your friend and it's familiar to you or an image of her inner seeing or even seeing outwardly seeing is an energy. Mindfulness is not just a word. Whatever it touches I'm making it external but it could be internal. Look have you had the experience when you're really mindful of the breath? You're not trying to change the breath. It's not pranayama. You're not controlling the breathing but just by being aware of it something happens to the breath and it's usually beneficial. Or when you're aware of certain emotions. And if you're really able to sustain a little bit of mindfulness the emotion becomes less dangerous if it's a negative emotion. So you have to take it on as a practice. And that means a bad situation is a good situation. So the next time when are you going to see this person? Next Friday. Great. What time? Noon. Noon. Just before that just jump up and down and click your heels and Yippee. I'm going to see X. And it's a good idea to prepare yourself because this is a challenge and probably the old machinery will go into effect because it's years of conditioning and understand. Oh and it's not that you're seeing her as an object. What am I doing? I'm just using her to practice and to get liberated. She's just dead meat there. It actually can improve your connection with her because if this stuff starts losing its potency you're going to be more intimate with her. It's going to be more honest. Now I'm not promoting an ideal and here's why. I say this is very important because sometimes this question comes up with people who are having trouble in relationship or marriages and this will show you the truth. And sometimes it means that people should get divorced and sometimes it means that they can stay together and learn a way of really living together in a wonderful way. So awareness will just show you what is that's? The whole beauty of it. So please start how lucky you are. I wish I had someone like that coming up soon. The rest of it was what I went through. Exactly. You can. That's another point. The reason I'm going because this is about all of us especially sometimes. One very useful approach of the pasta is you're focused on objects. You're here then here in the body let's say and it's very moving from one object to another. Then when someone says how about externally? Then it feels like you're trying to do two things at the same time. There's another kind of awareness which is all inclusive comprehensive global. And you're doing it now. In other words you're aware of me but there are other things. If a loud truck goes by you're going to hear it. Okay so yes just relax a little and let your awareness. There really no inside and outside. But it sure feels that way. You know how it turns out. And you probably sue me if it gets worse. It's a different tradition. It's an enigmatic. For example what is the sound of one hand clapping? You can't solve it rationally. It's to kind of throw a monkey wrench into the rational mind. So that for example what did your face look like even before your parents were born? Okay so the rational mind can't figure it out whereas it's been spended slides figuring a lot. You can't. Logically you can. And then the answer will be the teacher will just ring a Bell get out. Okay so there's a way in which it incapacitates. It sort of short circuits the rational mind and it takes you to clear seeing. It's just another method. We don't teach it here. Please. Okay Passover is there a question here? Because otherwise I want to make up stuff. What? It's the question for all of us. Passover for those of you who are not the Jewish ethnic persuasion or whatever am I correct in this? I think I was born into an Orthodox home but I'm very far away from it. I'm teaching Passover. Okay. I don't know but I'll just tell you what my response is to what you're saying is that my memory of it is that it's a celebration of getting free from slavery and from being enslaved to the Egyptians. And there are all kinds of ways foods that are very bitter to remind us of what it was like to be slaves and so forth. Now on one level that's outer slavery which is an abomination no human being should be slaves. To any other human beings. But even in the Jewish teachings not even in the what are called esoteric Jewish teachings it's really about inner slavery. So they're both needed. In other words if a person is enslaved outwardly then that has to be taken care of. This is not to neglect the outer world. It might even help you do better at it. But isn't that what you're getting at? Well I was going to take a more Buddhist please in the sense that that question is asked once a year. What's the question? I could answer that my own way but go ahead. That's right. But so is every other night. Yes. In fact so is the next moment. You can't step into the same moment. Yeah. Now this is as you know said by a Greek philosopher. Probably you can't do that. Now what the Buddha would add is the person stepping in to the stream. It isn't the same stream but that person also isn't the same person because everything is in constant flux. Everything is changing. And if you meditate you can't miss it. It's just so obvious. Is that okay? Yeah. What is it you don't like to do? I thought maybe it was my Rabbi Reincarnated as you Rabbi Minkowitz and that he was here for retribution. I'm not that clever. I was just taking your that would be more going the direction of Cohan. She's clever and we're trying to dumb everyone down here.

Thinking is an extraordinary human ability. One of the problems is that we've done so much of it and we're so good at it and we've gotten paid for it rewarded for it or punished for it if we're not good at it and we haven't examined it because we're so busy thinking that we don't know what actually is happening while we're engaged in the activity of thinking. So thinking has its place. I'm just working on my income tax today. I hope one plus one equals two. So thinking is a brilliant human skill. But what typically happens with prompts question like yours? I don't know if this does but it often does. Is that because there's so much cultural value and not just this culture? On thinking we emphasize not thinking. Now the direction of the practice is definitely to go to that place which is beyond thinking. There's no question all the schools leave there. Maybe all real religious spiritual practice goes to that place beyond because thinking is made up. But let's say you begin to tap in what in Buddhist terms is sometimes called emptiness. A spacious infinite quality of mine which is quite extraordinary and worth getting to. But then it's not like you then don't remember your name or your address or you just walk around. Excuse me. And you need a policeman or anything. It's mysterious to me. It's mysterious because you have access to the cultural information thinking and you can use it but it's coming from a different place. It's like a clear mind. And more and more we're learning when to use thinking and when not to. What you may find is an enormous amount of energy is squandered in unnecessary thinking. We have the same thoughts. Listen to your mind if you have the stomach again and again. Sometimes maybe this friend. How long do you know this person? How long do you know this person? Almost 20 years. Okay 20 years ago. And now you may be having the same thought. Why doesn't Hilda strength. When is Hilton going to learn that? Hillary when we were in junior high school I was telling Hillary so by awareness that part is dissipating an enormous amount of energy which when we don't do that that energy is available to us and then we could use it. So it's learning when to use thinking. And to begin with we need much more help in learning how to is the difference between thinking and mindfulness of that thinking is happening clear to you because it's all the difference in the world. Okay in practice thinking is happening and if you identify with it Then you make thinking you're thinking. And typically we believe in our thoughts or at least a lot of them. And then that propels us into action. And sometimes the actions it seems like we're doing it Whereas the thoughts have immense authority over us and they tell us do that kill that person and then we kill the person. What I do. So when you start examining it if you're aware that thinking is happening you'll see that thoughts don't have very much power. They're poor little creatures. They're like homeless and rootless. They come up. And the power they have is because we identify with them. And certain thoughts like I'm an American proud to be an American. We may have had that thought Buttressed by emotion for many years. That's a powerful thought unexamined. Again I'm not advocating one way or another but what can happen is then that takes some of the potency out of thought and slavishly. We're not enslaved to thought. And thought makes time. It makes up a future. Thought is the past and all there is is the present. So a lot of what meditation is about Is coming to timelessness. Timelessness simply means fully being in the present moment. There is no such thing as the past and there is no such thing as the future. Those are ideas. And when they happen memories happen but they happen now. And when you make up an idea of what the future is going to be you're making it up. Up now. So all there is is now. And that's why all this proliferation of books all about now.

That's good. Now when they started to let's say move in on your turf. So first of all it was your turf. It was your walking right. And there was a little bit of suffering there wasn't there? Yeah. Right. Okay then you saw it. I'm just trying to repeat what you said. I want to make sure I am. And then what happened? Well I accepted it. Accepted it? Meaning were you observing it or did you talk yourself out of it or did your intelligence say oh this is ridiculous. This is not my Lane. Let him have it. I assume it's a him. Was it a him? No. Things are too predictable. Okay. Lawful. Excuse me? It's nature. And then it passed. And then could you feel the relief or the release? Yeah but I didn't think about it anymore. Okay. If you remember yesterday what was suggested is if you feel the suffering that goes on no matter how small it is and then if the letting go happens and you also feel the relief or the release when the letting go happens if the mind can see both of these it begins to learn what that whole process is about. And so it becomes slightly more intelligent for the future. I was standing in the food line at lunch or breakfast. I'm not sure which meal actually. I was first in the line and the rounding here let off and there was this rush of people. It felt like this big wave of people walking through to get their dishes and somebody came with their dishes and stood right in front of me in the line. That was the first in the line. I was very aware of being first in the line. And the next thing that happened was that this person went forward to read the labels what was going to be for lunch and then backed up and was actually threatening to step on my feet. The back of my and it was just like you described. There was this ride. It's just like sort of hair on the back. It was rise against this person who was invading my space. And the thing that was really noticeable was the rise. It was that onset of suffering. Exactly. And I noticed that the moment it started up to the mind and it was just that it was just the quality of me. This is my faith. I was first in line and this person is now going to step on mine. I told this person to back. If they back up how can it be so oblivious? And as soon as I focused on that quality of me and the mind as I focused on it it got larger and then it just completely passed. Could you feel like a moment's relief when it passed? Yeah it's just gone. The suffering was there as long as I wasn't looking at it in the moments before I looked at it when the mind was running through what is this person doing? How can they be so oblivious? That was when there was the supreme. And these things come up all day long in very small ways. And if we can learn to be sensitive to them it can be very helpful. Yes. Was that a man who backed into. Me. Just doing a sociological survey. Is that something that comes. You better let that one go. Yeah. But go ahead. Excuse me I'm just rude sometimes. Do you think that standing up to your rights that people who let go are just patsies? No the letting go is not that it can be but letting go is an inner response. Let me give you an example. There was a Tibetan Lama who came to the Cambridge Center and he gave a talk on appreciation of what others do for us. Let's say you have a meal appreciating all that went into that the farmers and the trucks that brought it there everything that went into you having a meal or you have a job and appreciating you working in this factory and all that the boss had to do to get all the contacts and raise the capital and get the building built et cetera so that you could have your job to have appreciation for that. And then he said that but if someone had a job there and let's say it was promised $400 a week and the boss only gave him $200 then this llama asked us well what would you do? And people got really confused on that. And what he said was it's not that this is the only thing to do. But he said well one thing that was fine to do would be to be grateful for what the boss had done in providing you even with the $200 because it was all of his energy and effort that made that factory possible and then sue him for the remaining $200. Now you don't have to have hatred in your heart or even be attached. You can function as a person in a society using all the vehicles or the mechanisms that exist to redress trouble that's been done to you et cetera. Letting go doesn't mean that you don't. It has nothing to do with objects. It's your relation to the notice. You could be a multimillionaire and be free or you could have nothing and be in bondage. See the letting go is your relationship to whatever it is but it's not necessarily in the form. It's not in the particular form. You could defend yourself and inside be free. Do you see what I'm trying to say? Okay why does it follow that if somebody is learning to be free that they are walked over or that they're a Patsy? Why is that follow? I'm trying to understand your reasoning. I'm not sure if this will help but maybe a little bit. Presumably the Buddha was quite free. For our sakes let's hope he was free very free and yet was a highly dynamic person very skillful in action who accomplished an enormous amount Mount in one lifetime. So much so that the momentum is still going on now. And here's this building where it's still going on. And he must have been just a consummate artist of letting go of not getting caught anywhere but yet it was very effective. Gandhi was effective. Mother Teresa is effective. You can be effective. I once asked the Zen master if during World War II if he would have had a chance to assassinate Adolf Hitler would he have done it? Because if he had killed out of Hitler he could have saved let's say many other lives. Now we're not supposed to kill et cetera. And he paused for a long time. He wasn't flipping about it. And he said in his broken Korean you know who I'm talking? And he said Sometimes maybe kill is good. Now he also acknowledged that the person who would do that might have to pay the Karma of killing. But the intention was one of really preventing suffering. So it's more complex. We're not cardboard figures. Just because you step onto the path life is very challenging and it's not always clear as to what the right thing to do is. And ultimately each one of us has to decide what is right for us to do from moment to moment. So letting go is developing a relationship to whatever it is that we do that's light that can let it happen and then when it's done it's over with. So if you get literal about the content that spiritual. That's what I meant about the cosmetics. You would think well if somebody's letting go they've let go of cosmetics they've let go of high heels they've let go of three piece suits. They must be more spiritual. Not necessarily. The real question is have they really let go or have they got a new attachment which is to an image of letting go of somebody a person who's let go looks this way. They don't have the following possessions. I had one teacher who was a millionaire a Yogi an Indian extraordinarily free person. I don't know if I've met anyone more free. He seemed really free. I worked very intensively with him for four years. And part of what he did was he was free with money. He used his own money very skillfully for all kinds of good things and was very light about it. He valued money he respected it and he took responsibility for the fact that he had a lot of it. Now if you get into these black and white things you'd say well how could he be a Yogi? He's a millionaire. Yogis can't be millionaires. They have to be poor. I met some poor yogis who have a ways to go in terms of certain things. So that's what you can't get to. Does that help at all? Not very much. Okay good. Anyone else find any small stuff hanging around? Ims you're nodding. Only big stuff. I just want small stuff. What. They had put out all this asparagus and the dairy people were eating cream of asparagus food and I don't eat dairy products. So I was over there having my asparagus and I noticed these people with their caregivers. Your kind of people. Oh wow. But I knew what I was doing. I knew that I was playing game with people and they didn't know I was watching them and then finally that what I saw was the last person the last non dairy person come in and get the very last two spirits. Of spirit and then you were free. I wasn't able to really let go of it. In other words I think I still hold on to it until I was sure that everybody was okay. No it sounds but let me qualify it so that you don't throw the whole thing out. I think there is a rule that if you sign up to be on the special foods line then only those who've signed up should go to special foods isn't that correct? Yes. Okay. And if you didn't sign up for those of you who do it if you didn't sign up for special foods and you're going over there it needn't be an egotistical thing or even an eye mine selfing kind of thing on your part it could just be an objective observation. Seeing that they're not supposed to do that that does undermine the system that means that those people who signed up perhaps they won't have food. It is true. So that the whole thing could have happened you could have even not necessarily snitched to the kitchen but perhaps even told some of that really or whatever and you inside could have been not attached to it. It's just a matter of this is the way the arrangement is set up for a reason. It's an intelligence behind it. It's not just random and that if we all agree then the thing will work and if we don't it's going to cause problems and resentments that's it. Okay right? So that's it. One last one especially if it's really small you're going to have to belt it out. Yeah well your mind was better than mine my mind thought couldn't they have done it during an hour when we're not sitting? Where do we have a moment of silence.", 'human_start_time': '0:40:21'}, {'talkname': '19850309-Larry_Rosenberg-UNK-heroic_joyous_effort-1524', 'question_num': 'Question 1', 'url': '/talks/1524/19850309-Larry_Rosenberg-UNK-heroic_joyous_effort-1524.mp3', 'display_name': 'Heroic Joyous Effort', 'date': '3/9/85 0:00', 'start_time': 2903650, 'content': "Courage efforts are very appropriate right now. I'm happy that. So one of the ways in which effort is developed is through let's say people call teachers. There's another source that I neglected to mention which for some people can be very helpful. And perhaps this will be for you. I'd like to get back to it in terms of how to work with the fear but as a source of inspiration to help generate energy and effort so that the effort gradually becomes steady independent of the fluctuation of whether you're in a good space or not so good. There's a harmonious steady outflow of effort and the effort is balanced. It's not pinched by striving or anxiety of trying to get somewhere. It's like the middle that the Buddha talked about and that is for some people reflecting on the spiritual heritage. Now if you read in Buddhist texts they're talking about the great yogis who have lived all of whom have gone through the same things we're going through. And here is a very very important point. I think the Buddha wasn't always enlightened. He had to get there. He had to work really hard. Now this particular approach to spiritual development in Vipasana comes out of the experience of that human being and has left a certain important coloration to it which may or may not appeal to you. But I think it should be made explicit. The Buddha was not a savior and time and time again. And that's why effort is so central in this system pointed out that all that he could do is point the way that you have to do the work. Each one of us has to do the work. And so it's that kind of path with tremendous emphasis on personal research testing experience developing self reliance confidence in ourselves perhaps starting with faith however that's generated and the faith becoming less essential as our experiences become stronger and more convincing. And so sometimes reading the lives I would enlarge it of course it's not by any means a monopoly of Buddhism. It's all the great Saints and sages which are a legacy of the entire human race within the Buddhist tradition. You can read the life of Millareppa what he was willing to go through for freedom and maybe that's a prerequisite a real yearning for freedom for all of us. And sometimes reading these lives in whatever religion or tradition or no religion of other human beings just like ourselves who've gotten fed up with being crazy and destructive and unfulfilled and dangerous. King Ashoka in ancient India who was an Emperor who was responsible for the death of many people in war became repulsed by all of the destruction that he had contributed to and became an extraordinary Pacific and benign and spiritually evolved Emperor King. So sometimes in general for all of us a few paragraphs of people who have lived before us we didn't just get shot out of a Cannon. I mean this has been going on for a while sometimes understanding that we're connected to live people right now all of us here in this room and also other human beings who've been as bent out of shape as us and maybe worse you find yourself having some fear and it's come up today. Again one thing that can help to generate energy and effort to face the fear is an understanding of the enormous cost that fear has entailed in being controlled by fear. Do you see it as a very high or perhaps the highest let's limit it just say a very high priority in your own life to come to terms with fear. Honestly do you feel that that's a very high value for you to come to understand your fears so that you can release yourself? Is that part of your consciousness much? Yeah. You see because sometimes what can help you is if you start to see in the moment the cost of fear how much it limits us. Are you really seeing a specific concrete instance of it where you can't flower fully as a human being because of being afraid of something? And so sometimes seeing that can generate energy so that you can very gently approach the fear even if you have to swallow hard and even if there are tears coming down your cheeks you move towards it little by little and perhaps you start to find out that it's not so difficult after all it's something that can be learned. We can learn how to examine our fears how to fully experience them and then something happens in the process of doing that. Yeah. Could you be more clear about the potential. At the same time? That's right. Probably all of us face that slowly learning how to not be afraid of fear and wanting to be free of it that generates tremendous energy. And that's where a lot of the joy can come in. Sometimes tasting just a spurt a bit of freedom. When we're willing to look at something unpleasant and seeing that it was manageable leave it at that. Any other questions or comments about effort in regard to your own practice? Sure. Where you see acceptance coming into effort because part of the effort for me is always more than what is the moment. It's not enough. We're it's too much. I don't know. It may be a language problem because to really observe fear to really be mindful of fear you have to allow fear. The courage comes in in having the trust to allow the fear out to allow the fear to reveal itself. See to accept fear is a posture or we're doing something to the fear. And as I understand it at least what I'm suggesting the looking and the listening is direct and pure. It has no motive in it of getting rid of anything. It's just permitting fear to fully express itself to fully unravel itself to reveal itself. And sometimes that means to sit still and be receptive enough so that fear is not contorted by any kind of conceptual overlay that you may put on it including accepting it. See accepting it is an attitude. What I'm talking about is being aware of it as it is. If you decide to accept it you've already treated it a bit. Do you follow it? And that's on the way. But at a certain point you can even let go of that. It's not a matter of accepting the fear. It's a matter of allowing fear to be fear. And very gently and decisively being there as fear is fear as it shows itself reveals itself. But part of your question I think we all know when we're pushing again the example of the loot when it's too loose or too tight. One thing to watch for is if there's anxiety accompanying the effort or as if the effort has got some ambition in it or a lot of fear in it and then I would turn awareness on those qualities themselves. And you can sometimes tell from the result. The practice gets joyless stale. We feel tired if there's too much pushing and if there's not enough if we keep retreating and avoiding things sometimes we feel a bit of remorse. We know that we haven't given our best. We know that we've in some ways moved away from it. And again not to view that in a harsh way but just objectively we've seen that and then we pick ourselves up and very gently move again towards whatever is coming up. Is that at all? It's so dark that I seem to need feedback. My own experience in particular you touched on that. I know I experience lots that disappointment in the moment of not putting in effort out. Okay. Now when you have that when the energy is there isn't there an exuberance that follows from it? Yeah. Let's take the example of physical pain because I'm pretty sure that everyone has had an opportunity to or will have to work with that. That's an object that the mind doesn't want to look at. But if you can gracefully if you can be with it perhaps at the beginning not too long if you feel that you're overdoing it let it go not sit too long too. If you have control over how long you're going to sit sometimes use a chair. It's working that edge. But the time comes where you sit through the pain what is called pain with full awareness. And you see that you penetrate it and somehow it isn't what you thought it was. It perhaps dissolved. And there's a tremendous feeling of exuberance that you really met at eye to eye. And from that point on the factor of effort is strengthened. See it keeps getting strengthened like that.", 'human_start_time': '0:48:23'}, {'talkname': '19850309-Larry_Rosenberg-UNK-heroic_joyous_effort-1524', 'question_num': 'Question 2', 'url': '/talks/1524/19850309-Larry_Rosenberg-UNK-heroic_joyous_effort-1524.mp3', 'display_name': 'Heroic Joyous Effort', 'date': '3/9/85 0:00', 'start_time': 3908430, 'content': "Pain and fear.

You pass a law inside your mind that you will no longer have any self imposed limits. Good. Other words move as decisively as you can. But you may find here's what I mean. If fear comes up and you've heard the encouragement and the suggestions this evening but there's a feeling of tremendous terror that you're going to be go insane that you don't feel up to it. You're not even close. It might be wise to back off and go to the breath do some walking begin to strengthen yourself in certain ways. And as we say it's a marathon. It's a long. It's not a sprint to which to the fear you must be a human being. What? And has the practice helped you with that? I haven't been practicing long but I can see. What can you see? I can see in the sense that. I've read a lot on astrology and. The configuration shows that there is development tension of one kind or another. So as long as the tension is there. But it's also bringing constructive development. Okay. Have you seen any of this in your actual sittings? No not I haven't really. I've been here for a week but last evening was the first completely relaxed. I suppose this is quite natural. I'm also a person who could be anxiety ridden. What brought you here? What brought you here? The launching. What is the effort that brought you here? My husband was going back to Indiana. Good old Ramdass. Would you do anything that Ramdas told you to do? I'm trying to understand what inside you. Brought you to this practice the effort of the launching effort to get it going to start it. I think that it's about ten years now that the cycle of my life changed. Working and teaching and learning. And suddenly everything came to an end. And astrologically I knew the sun had moved into PISCES. Something is going to happen. Finally I went into direction. This is just an overview of it. And the climate everywhere. Wherever you leave wherever there are sessions of all time going on and you do get sucked into them. Okay? Now if you got sucked into this one and if there isn't some good down to Earth solid empirical confirmation that there's something of value in a human being paying attention to what's happening to them from moment to moment. I would say you'd be wasting your time here. You won't stay. I mean it's not here that's important. You won't continue doing the practice. See at some point even Ramdas will fade out and Astrology will fade out. If there isn't this inner sense that this is a worthwhile thing for human being to do. It'll lose energy. All of us some way. The mind will be concentrated. Partially. Yes. You're Indian. Yes. Okay you're all set. You have it in your jeans. We Americans. We have to work so hard for it grafted onto ourselves. Okay let's start to do the walking meditation again.

So I said Well I do research. And he said what kind? I told him mainly work on lockwater of a mental hospital chronic people called schizophrenics. Chronic schizophrenics long term. And he backed away from me at a mile a minute. And he said well you'd never catch me in a place like that doing anything like that. Are you kidding? I wouldn't go near that. Wow. How do you do it? And I looked at him and I said how do you do it? And what I realized is that I didn't earn anything. He didn't earn anything. It came pretty easily to me to tell you the truth. So I was that kind of a person who can do that kind of a thing and he was the kind of person who can do the other kind of a thing. And I couldn't do his thing and he couldn't do my thing. And it really helped me understand a lot about fear and personal differences and starting points. So we come to this practice of Vipasana meditation and stripped of the technical language and adornments essentially what you're being asked to do is to take stock of yourself to just see just what actually am I? What did I bring into this building? And the simpler the better. And we start with something so fundamental as the breath. If you think of it as just a concentration exercise I think you're limiting it. When we begin to pay attention to the breath it often is described that way as a concentration exercise. It certainly is that. But there's much more to it. You're noticing that you're breathing. Each one of us shares that. We bring that with us. We're breathing. Try not doing it. See what happens? Sometimes that realization can improve your concentration very quickly faster than some of the technical hints when you suddenly realize that I'm paying attention to a process which if it didn't happen I wouldn't happen. This breath we can't go too long without it. And so from a very profound point of view what we're doing we're noticing we're breathing in and we're breathing out and this is the way the breath happens. And then the suggestion is made well why don't you walk? Take a walk. Okay I'll do that. And then we lift and move in place and we walk. Do you see the similarity? We're starting to notice how we walk and how we are uncomfortable with this and like that. And then it moves on to eating. And before you know by the afternoon certainly before that the mind comes in feelings come in everything's there. And the heart of this practice is beginning with what we have or it's being right there with what we have. And it's not just for beginners. I've been doing this for a while and it's the same for me because we're always just who we are from moment to moment. It's a very humbling thought. This afternoon I had a nice chat with Rodney who was on the staff here who's been sitting for a long time and been a Monk. And we kind of converged on this point which I think is why I'm talking about it about how the beauty of the practice if you're doing it is that it helps you become more human. It helps you become what you already are more fully. In the deepest sense you might say Buddha nature and your original nature enlightened our full potential. True. But I'm saying even at the beginning maybe there's no point in even thinking of beginning. Sort of every moment at the beginning is that we are waking up to how it is to be us right now in this moment and then we just keep doing that and then we forget to do that and we create illusory notions about ourselves all kinds of dramatic imaginary fanciful. I wish I could only be where I used to be and we get lost in it. And that's okay too. The practice says Fine beautiful. So you're the kind of person who has a lot of fantasies about what you think you should be. That's all. It's not saying crush them out. We're being very respectful to absolutely every aspect of our existence without exception totally without exception. That's where the continuity comes in. And that's in a way where the practice becomes quite ruthless in its gentleness because it's asking you to be who you are from moment to moment. And apparently that's not the easiest thing in the world to do. It's kind of training to learn how to get to where we are from where we are to where we are which sounds like a silly exercise. And it would be except for the fact that we're always trying to get from where we are to where we think we should be which is some ideal and some imaginary notion about how it could be if we were. But it isn't what we are in that moment. I'm not on grass. It's just coming out this way. You sit for a few months and you'll sound this incoherent too. So we always seem to want other things. We don't want to be where we are or be with the people that we're with or eat what we have or want want. And what we don't seem to want is what we already have. And these instructions are gently but firmly returning our attention to what we already have and emphasizing that from moment to moment you can't miss it after a while or you really will stop doing this practice. And I'm not saying that some of the things that the books talk about extraordinary lights and incredible joy. And sure that happens too. But this is a lifetime practice. It's a lifetime sentence. It really is. It's not a weekend retreat. Maybe some of you had some nice meditation experiences those who are really beginners although it happens to all of us at whatever level. You sat for a few hours and you felt some clarity. Wow. And if I go at a Barry let's see look at this schedule. And they sit for ten to 12 hours a day. And I felt this good just sitting my little half 20 minutes in the morning 20 minutes at night. So if I multiply that by two days times 12 hours I'll be that much more joyful and at peace and compassionate. I can't wait to get there. And those of us who come here for three months and longer to some degree some of the motivation may be that too. You feel so good doing as much meditation as you're doing in quotes out there that you come running to here and thinking that it will just multiply in some kind of mathematical way. It doesn't quite go that way. Have you noticed it's so unpredictable. You just have to keep picking up the string and beginning and beginning so that it sounds corny but it's literally true that you just keep beginning. It is really a practice for beginners because you're attentive and you're with yourself exactly as you are. And then you lose it. And maybe five minutes go by or 5 hours go by five days go by and then you pick it up again and you start again. Just what is it? How is it now? And it just keeps being that endlessly from moment to moment. Whether you're at Barry or in Cambridge or sitting or walking there's absolutely no place to get to. There's no escape. There's just us following us wherever we are. And the practice is helping us to really zero in on that to really pay attention to the texture of each moment for ourselves. That means that the most ordinary and most routine seemingly humdrum type things that happen are as valuable as what seemed to be extraordinary spiritual meditation experiences. And the reason they are is because that's what our life is at that moment. That's all that is actually our life at that moment. Having to go to the toilet for the 200000th time and noticing that the toilet paper roll it's almost used up and that if you use it then you'll have to put a new roll of toilet paper on the roll. I don't know if you noticed that. I see that at IMS a lot. In fact what people will do is. That they'll leave just a little bit of paper. So that way they don't have to take a new role. They don't have to feel well I used up the last bit of paper and I'm going to be a good Yogi and generosity and all that. So you just leave a little bit hanging. So the next person comes in they have to take that role and put it on to this thing. And how many more times do we have to go through this brushing our teeth and getting dressed? And this practice is saying it's fully acknowledging that there's a certain tedium after let's say teenage when you've gone to the toilet for the millionth time and done so many things over and over and over and over and over. There's a Zen exchange that's somewhat relevant I feel to our situation regarding that a Zen student asked the Zen master we're endlessly dressing and eating. How do we get out of that? Implying you know just the enormous tedium of it the routineness of it. And the Zen master answered we dress and we eat. And then the student said I don't understand. And so the teacher said back well then just go and get dressed and eat. What's being said is that if we do it totally or if there's full attention to that simply because that's what's happening. We happen to be brushing our teeth. We happen to be tying our shoelaces. If there's full attention if there's real openness there's just brushing our teeth then it's not tedious then we've escaped. That's how we've gotten out of it. So you kill the tedium not by killing it. It's only a concept anyway. Each thing is happening fresh. Each moment. Even that brushing of the teeth is the first time it's happened quite that way. But because we live in memory so much rather than the actuality of what's happening we have this obstinate familiarity of how many more times I have to brush my teeth and floss. That's even worse for some of us impossible. But when it's just brushing our teeth when we're really there doing it the whole quality of consciousness is very different. And it almost has nothing to do with what you're doing but how you do it. Someone in one of the retreats like this who really heard who suggested that in cutting up the vegetables really cut the vegetables. And this person did it and was ecstatic. They said I'm a Cook and I have to chop up vegetables a lot. And during the work here I cut up the broccoli and it was just incredible. It was just wonderful because I was really alert. I was really fully doing it cutting up the broccoli and the person was ecstatic. It was really a very wonderful experience. And I've been cutting up vegetables for years and it's been okay but not like this. So if you get literal about it then we'd all go running after broccoli and knives and start cutting it up. The joy isn't in the broccoli or in the knife is that that person was fully alive in that moment doing that particular task. That's what they were doing at that moment. From what I've gathered there's a bit of confusion as to how to work with physical pain. Have any of you had some discomfort today? It's a rhetorical question and maybe we can apply this very simple perspective of just taking account very simply and innocently of how things are for us right in this moment. We can use pain. And if you move with me through this regarding pain you'll see that perhaps it can be helpful in other areas of the practice what is sometimes called the hindrances or just obstacles to what it is that we want. We want clarity and serenity and all that kind of stuff. Instead we get pain. But that's the truth. It's not good or bad. It's just true that we find that our ankle hurts. So that's what you have at that moment. Your life includes an ankle that's like that. And maybe mine doesn't. Maybe mine is the ear. Okay? You're sitting and you find that a part of your body is troubled. What we call pain. We're already in trouble. When we call it pain or to call it P-A-I-N that's a very bad word. It's already a condemnation. Shrieking and howling and dentist's office and doctor's offices and fist fights. All the associations with that term pain. As soon as we just verbally connect with that experience and all it is is some sensations let's say in the leg. Very often there's not much of a gap. The sensations occur pain. And then if pain comes what's very close to it is oh my God how am I going to get out of this one? Why did I come here? There must be more to meditation than this. I'm too old for this. This is only for young people. I'm doing it wrong. There must be a way to do it right. I hate meditation. When is the Bell going to ring? And before you know it it's reached epidemic proportions. Okay let's back off. Let's see how that was produced how that came about what happened? Some of these cells in the body they're rearranging. They don't like it keeping your leg in a certain way for a long period of time. And they feel tired of being that way. They want to move around and dance and you're keeping your leg a certain way. So they start pounding at you and saying We've had enough of this. Step number one is that let's say you're working with the breath. And clearly this has become a problem. These sensations in the body and it's taking you away from the breath at that moment. Let go of the breath and just bring a very gentle open attentiveness. I'm going to have to call it pain but it's pain in quotes. Whereas we know there's a difference between the name and what the name is pointing to. It's very important I hope you'll see that. So we bring a very gentle but firm attention to those sensations in the body or could be the mind. But for right now let's limit it to the body and we listen. I'm using listening now as a metaphor. We just very carefully listen to the body for what it's saying at that moment. Then the question is how to do it? Are we really doing it correctly? A few hints. The listening that's being suggested here has no motive in it of accomplishing anything. In other words if you're listening to the pain in order to get rid of it you're not listening to it because part of your attention is on those sensations. And another part is in future tense wishing that this were over wishing that you'd be home already wishing that you were at tea whatever it is a yoga class whatever. Now how to get the mind to observe to listen without any motive. You can't force it. That would be exhausting and violent. But what you can do is begin to see how hard it is for the mind to just simply look and to simply listen. That is we've had so much training in terms of when we look at anything it's motivated. What am I going to get out of it? We look at a person. Is that a relationship or is it not a relationship? Is that business transaction academic advantage some kind of advantage? Or we look at nature we categorize it some kind of botanical thing. I want to be nice. If I could own that. If I could get that maybe I will. Maybe I can buy it. So it's so hard to just look. Kind of almost an aesthetic appreciation of whatever it is that's in front of you. It's usually colored with some gaining idea. Something that we want out of the looking. Moreover the looking is conditioned by our whole history of how we've related to that particular things or things like it. And what we're learning here is this art of very simple. Just being there and letting the body reveal itself. Letting the body talk and tell its story. So that means the less you do the more you learn. But it's not conceptual learning. Whereas you're really just there. And you're hearing the body reveal itself. You're hearing the body tell its story in its own language. And if you can do nothing but just really be totally there for it. It's quite astonishing as to what happens. It seems as if the pain. What we call pain diminishes. Or it even disappears altogether. It turns out to be something else. Now what I'm trying to say is that what we're doing is in a sense uncoupling. If you think of let's say trains that are coupled linked. If we're not sensitive to the fact that the mind is one thing and the body is another. There was this very simple approach to how it is for us. In each moment something happens to the body those sensations. And immediately the mind gets involved in it. And it makes up a story about it. Oh my God. This is awful. This is terrible. Kangaroo is going to set in. They're going to have to operate all the different kinds of things. Now if we can't separate what the mind is adding to the body it becomes suffering. It's no longer just pain. It's now suffering. Because the mind and body get mixed in together. And there's no clarity on our part. So that the concept plus the experience becomes real suffering. The most important concept of all that makes it suffering. Takes these sensations and makes it really very very difficult. Is the concept of I. It's my pain. This pain belongs to me. How could this be happening to me? I want to be comfortable. And it's sort of a personal affront. It feels terrible that this is my body and I'm in pain. And me me I I. And as the mind learns to be more simple. And just come to the body. And see the body is the body and the mind is the mind. They're related but they're really different. And so we just experience the body. And then when the mind goes on and starts making up all kinds of stories and interpretations as to what is happening with the body we don't stamp that out because that's what we have at that moment. That's our possession. That's how we're manifesting. We listen to it but we hear it for what it is. The mind is making up a story for the bodily experience. And sometimes now and then it's even an intelligent story. That's appropriate. I'm not saying don't listen to it. It might be very appropriate in terms of guidance as to rearrange your posture. It might say look I don't care what they say about not moving. You better move because this is too much for you. Okay I'll do it. So I'm not saying don't listen to the mind but as you increase your sensitivity to this interplay between mind and body you start to become more and more sensitive to where the mind is intelligent and in accordance and aligned with reality with what's happening to the body and where it's just way out of line and where there's just a lot of projecting and paranoia and terror and imagination and where it's making life much much more difficult for us. Let me give you an example. I've been trying to develop examples that don't come from agricultural ancient India but that apply to this teaching just for a comic relief now and then something about our society. The only thing that came to mind about the analogy to this would be remember this is again staying with physical pain. Say you're watching TV and there's a sporting event on assuming that you like sports and you understand let's say it's a basketball game and you know the rules and the players and it's a nice big screen color the whole thing. And you know exactly what's happening. You can see it. It's being shown to you on the screen. But then there's also an announcer and the announcer gets paid for talking about what's happening on the screen. You know what I mean in a certain way. If the announcer is for the home team they talk about what's happening in a certain way because they're talking to patrons of that team. If the announcer is for the other team they talk about it in a slightly different way because they know that their audience wants to hear it a certain way. And so the levels of excitement and ecstasy and disappointment intentional. The point is that somebody is creating a reality with words about what you can plainly see in front of you. The two come together and as you're watching the announcer and those just bare physical images create in a way another reality which your mind enters into. Now if you just turn the announcer off for a few moments you can see exactly what's happening. You know all the players you know the rules. You see it just the way it is. Then you turn the announcer on and the announcer is at the top of his lungs. When certain things are happening for this team the mind is a little bit like the announcer constantly exaggerating and feeling just terrible about itself and wonderful. And life is happening the way it's happening. The basketball game is just happening. Balls are going through Hoops and people are running in short pants down the floor. It's just the way it's happening with sneakers. It's just all happening that way. So if we can't see that difference between that mind and body. In fact one of the early meanings of insight is insight into the difference between mind and body. It's one of the early levels of insight meditation. It's not trivial to be able to see that difference and it can help free us from a lot of unnecessary sorrow. So it's a simple activity. It's beginning with what we have from moment to moment. We have this body a certain way and we have this mind a certain way and we're not being asked to change it to trade your mind in as if you could. But what we're being asked to is to notice carefully very respectfully lovingly just how does our mind work about what's happening to our body right now? And that turns out to be a radical step to make. And the practice that's what I meant at the outset is a simple quality that we're developing of it's a kind of honesty of being with our life as it actually is learning how to do that and living from there with others. And we do it so much by finding out when we don't do it because as awareness becomes sharper it's pretty painful when you're off. I mean it's just a false note and you can hear it a final just kind of practical hint with pain because I know a number of you are really struggling today when you bring that awareness to the area that let's say is troubled. No matter what you've heard being said tonight it's very hard to not look at it with a certain intensity and wanting to be rid of it. As a result we kind of zero in on the pained area. And it's not just looking or just listening. It's very very highly motivated. And I found that one thing that can help soften that is if you're in pain is to not immediately bring the awareness to that. I mean of course it will go to it as soon as you know it but then sort of encircle it with awareness and then very gently enclose it until finally you're just there with it. In fact you can be with it and feel the whole body even better. And often what will happen is those energies which in a sense are trapped in that little part of the body that's under pain. When you experience it in the context of the whole body it's like those painful energies are reabsorbed diffused and somehow it all feels less than you thought it was. Not as bad. Okay so the attitude is one of moving through our day here and we still have tonight and all much of tomorrow in a very simple way not expecting things to turn out a certain way. And if we do noticing what happens often doesn't happen. Seeing what that means for us when we have expectations that are afforded learning from everything that's going on here. Simple thing like the breath. One person you hear the instructions and you're following in breath out breath in breath out breath and your mind wanders a lot. One person will respond to that by becoming very tight and willful. Okay I'll show the mind. And probably that's how we've dealt with everything that's come up in our life with powerful will and an idea of accomplishing something for us violence towards ourselves and perhaps others. Another person the same pattern of inattention to the breath and the person gets discouraged. I'll never learn it. Everyone in the hall is next to see. I'm the only one sitting here alone. I can't even find my nostrils let alone the breath. And then perhaps the question a well placed question from time to time. Do I do that in other things when things don't go my way do I quit? Do I do that in other things when things don't go my way I try to power my way through so you can see. You learn. It's self knowledge. This is all wisdom. Paths are founded on that selfknowledge and that's what we're embarking on. That's what we're doing. And it's a never ending journey. It's a marathon. Anyone have any questions or comments about what's been said or your own experience? Yes I'd like to get back to you. Yeah that doesn't sound like my experience but it may be yours. When it's habit you see. If you are aware then there's freshness. It isn't habit. You can be doing the thing and the body knows what to do. In other words the movements are you've done them many many times so you know what to do. The problem with habit is that very often that we're asleep. And so what seems more likely is that we do know how to brush our teeth and it happens just we may even get into all the cracks and hit the gums the right way and do everything the dentist said. And in the meantime what we're doing while we're doing that is solving Einstein's formula of relativity. And people will often say well why do I have to waste my time on such a trivial thing as brushing my teeth? And I could be planning out my day while I'm doing that or et cetera. There's something to be gained from being with the brushing of the teeth. In other words to bring that meditative state that you obviously do value to bring it to bear on the activity that you happen to be carrying out. Now I don't mean to make that a rigid principle because there are times in life where you may have to do some very quick thinking about things while doing something else. And we're pretty gifted. We can learn how to do that. So I don't mean to Harden it into an absolute. So I don't know that anything can be done with that way without causing trouble. What I am suggesting is in and of itself those tiny little behaviors like brushing your teeth are trivial let's say not from a dental point of view. From a consciousness point of view. It takes up let's say a minute or whatever. And why not? Why not fantasize or plan out what you're going to make for breakfast? What is he taking that away from us? What do we need to be with the arm feeling that and all that in and of itself? It's perhaps trivial. But see the problem is that our life is made up. It's like a mosaic. It's made up of all these seemingly trivial moments. Where does it stop? Well then taking out the garbage that's also trivial. Making the bed is trivial and washing your dishes is trivial. And before you know you realize my whole life is just a big bore. It's just all routine except Saturday night. It'll change or during the summer vacation or the three month course. Everything will be different then. So what this is designed to do is in a sense to uproot that whole way of living and to bring awareness into each moment. And in a way precisely because it's trivial or mundane it has tremendous learning potential. See because from another point of view that is your life at that moment. See this practice another way of putting it is that we're learning how to live more fully and our life is made up of these routine activities one after the other. And the degree to which we can be fresh and alert and alive in them is a statement I think a profound statement of the quality of our life rather than having particular outstanding moments that stand for our life ecstatic experiences that come around once every few months. And so that's the logic behind it. But if you don't want to pay attention to your teeth full speed ahead. Yeah. Anything else? Sure. I wonder if you could talk about fantasy and planning the future in the way that you talked about pain. Yes. In a group like this there was a ten week class on meditation and a fellow who was obviously loving it and benefiting it. And then in the 10th week everyone went around the room and said how it was for them and he was sad. He said I really am a little depressed. I mean now that this is over. And I love this whole thing about being in the moment not getting caught up in the future and past and all that he said. But my job I'm a city planner. Do I have to quit my job? His profession is planning planning. Mind planning. Planning it's no he should be able to be a better planner. In other words when he's planning then he would know he's doing planning. In other words we do have to plan. I had a plan not to come here. This was unplanned this morning. I wound up here. I thought I was going to be in my little nice little room meditating but I wound up here. But I have had to plan a lot of things. It's more that you don't get lost in the plans and that the planning doesn't come to replace the present actuality that we live in what might be or as a fantasy so much that we never tend to our actual life to get to fantasy. It's not that fantasy has to be abolished. In fact if it comes up we would become aware of it of the fantasy. But here's where inquiry becomes important. If the mind is spending a lot of time in fantasy and you see that in other words you take stock of yourself which is what all I've been saying. You see that my mind seems to do a lot. It's in the future a lot. I'll do this and then I'll do that. And then when I'm this I meet this person et cetera and then you investigate and you start to notice and perhaps you may find as many people have that there's a strong relationship between a lot of doing of that fantasy work and unfulfillment a lack of fulfillment in the present in our actual life. And so we're avoiding coming to terms with certain problems because of anxiety. And so there's a lack of fulfillment which is compensated by jumping into a fantasy a maybe world that will happen in the near future. And we go from one near future to the next near future. So that if you see through that then it's liberating it then points to action. It means that there is an area where some work needs to be done. There is a place where we find ourselves limited meditation. It's not all going to be solved by just sitting on the cushion. If you have that fantasy good luck. The cushion has to be connected with you have to leave the cushion at some point you have to go to the toilet you have to wash. And at some point we all leave here most of us anyway. So you're getting at that very interesting area connecting action and the sitting practice. And so someone else may be a creative writer and the fantasies may be used to produce all kinds of stories or whatever. It's not that that doesn't have its place and it could be quite rich but the question is are you using fantasy or is fantasy using you? Yes.", 'human_start_time': '0:10:23'}, {'talkname': '19840324-Larry_Rosenberg-UNK-beginning_with_what_we_have-1485', 'question_num': 'Question 2', 'url': '/talks/1485/19840324-Larry_Rosenberg-UNK-beginning_with_what_we_have-1485.mp3', 'display_name': 'Beginning With What We Have', 'date': '3/24/84 0:00', 'start_time': 2998690, 'content': "To the United States.

And we're finding the same percentage of child abuse and neglect when one woman with simple graph. I'm curious. When we go into a situation where there's child abuse neglect we need to identify the problems and set up a service goal that the canvas to reach and service planning. And Kim London moving said to it that when you come in please just talk to us about planning what you're going to do you're going to do this that and yes thing if you want your child to stay with you because. I don't know don't assume that if you go to the Orient everyone is sitting in deep States of Samadhi meditating. It's not true. They're probably trying scheming as some way to get into MIT. Okay. So the question is how to work with that situation. Yeah. I wouldn't have an answer for you. I think that your own expertise at some point will help you. But the degree to which you can be clear about what's happening and you can see what they're doing clearly part of for all immigrant groups that have come to go from any one culture to another reeducation is essential. If that particular immigrant group doesn't learn how to live in this culture there are always problems of isolation and frustration and so forth. So the question turns out how to help them learn how to live in this society because this is where they are now. I can't tell you how to do that. But certainly if you can establish some kind of trust with them then that's the beginnings of helping them to understand that this is tracing it out. And even let's assume that it's true that in that culture there isn't as much future orientation still because of what you described. They may have to learn how to live in a certain way which is necessary now. And so just you staying clear can help you with that process of their reeducation. But I wouldn't know how to do it. This is designed to help us. And any social situation that you're in of course anything that helps us will help the whole situation. One quick one. Sure. How do you monitor whether the fantasy is overtaking us if we are in control of it? It sounds redundant with the work. What I meant was let's say you're sitting in meditation and the fantasy comes upon you. It's there in your head. If you're in the fantasy it's like a soap opera and you're in it. You've identified with what's going on. There's not probably not. Much awareness they don't seem to go together. Whereas if the fantasy comes up and you know that fantasizing is happening it's very different then you're out of it. Unfortunately you might have to let go of the fantasy because what often happens is that the fantasies aren't as real as they seem to be and in the light of awareness they just fall apart. So many things. Do have any of you noticed? If you really look at it it's not as solid as we think. It is underlined think. But sometimes we kind of can hear the fantasy revealing itself and it can even teach us things that are let's say unconscious in us but we're really listening. We're not caught up in it. When you're caught up in it I guess the test would be the degree which you're mindful of it. You're not identified. You can't be both identified and mindful at the same time. So that if you're really mindful of what's happening then you're not caught in identifying with it and you'll see it as an impermanent process that comes up and it's gone. Sounds simple. It does. Well I have trouble with not being attached. I understand. Okay. Then we move to the next thing which is interesting. The fantasy comes up and then you notice I did what it says. I became aware of it and the fantasy never even got a chance to finish. And then I feel cheated. I used to enjoy my fantasies and now Vipassana has taken them away from me something like that. And it's really nice to just luxuriate in a kind of what those things do for us. Okay. There's what I mean there's that intersection between action and meditation. And sometimes it's a real choice that one has to make. Which fork in the road do you want to walk? And I don't say it to you knowing you at all. I'm speaking to all of us. It often points to the fact that if you want to grow you have to let go of certain things. They've served you to some degree as a compensation for a while. But if you keep doing it that way they're going to keep you from any real depth in growth. It's something like if I'm sitting right here in Massachusetts and I say I want to go to Rhode Island and I can start to kind of move and I'm almost in Rhode Island and I still have my foot. At some point I really have to raise up this foot and just get out of Massachusetts and be totally in Rhode Island. And if I want to have them both at the same time which is often what we face then that itself is something that we have to work with in meditation.

They come in unpredictable endless numbers. There's no knowing how many there will be. They may be enough to go past the work hour. They may be only 15 minutes worth of washing.

I was just spotted and I'm not that way. And I realized something that. When I. Have a clear mind or it seems like I have a clear mind here that I need the room clear. And. Yeah that's how I make the connection. And I couldn't even stand a piece of closing on the chair that bothered me. I was really sort of shocked at myself for the payment neck I might become at home. Now I had the job to clean the meditation hall and in the description it said put all the mats nice and square and keep them all. And at first I felt terribly on it. How could they give the job to somebody who has not meditated and has never been at the Center I mean has not meditated long and has never even been terribly terribly honest? Oh yes that's nice. And then of course what happened is they know what they know. They know what they're doing. Exactly. To give me this honor which made me happy. But also I thought they don't know what they're doing because he comes the German house fight them up. I started three or four different techniques to do the best way and discovered lots of things about that. And I didn't do a better job than I always do because when I clean I clean. I do it wholeheartedly. I may not like it but I'll do it. Actually I did like to do it but it's the same thing. Nothing got any cleaner as it already did. But what I'd like to tell you is the German house. I was at the square maps. I was simply overwhelmed by them because how I started it put everything in an exact order. And what amazed me how much I enjoy is getting things right. And I thought Here you go again. Because ever since I was a child they told me I'm judgmental. And I discovered this steep seated irrational pleasure. Taking something is funny. It didn't need to be that good and be done. And so I found a child in my bed. You see I thought I had mellowed to a great deal and to a great extent. And people didn't call me judgmental anymore. And I was still wary of being it. And he had back again. I set them right in the quiet see like when they were gone. And after I discovered that I felt very ashamed and slightly humiliated about this pleasure I had I was all right because I was telling them how to sit there also was rearranging these. And then I watched myself and found really that every day I did do a little less of straightening out and a little more of this ordinary cleaning. And I was with every minute like then it was almost right. I left it there. I made it almost it asked for myself. When the pillow was not exactly in the middle I said this is big enough. You can't keep it. It's a little interesting story of now how do we call this? Of judging oneself in a mellow way. In other words finding out about oneself and doing some little learning there in a very practical sense. After I had discovered that I hadn't really given up. But I thought I had given up. A few things about work here and in everyday life. My job was to prepare salads every day. I've had a kind of very work career. It seems as always in transitions in my life I find myself back in the kitchens by choice in part. I mean I didn't choose this job so this wasn't by choice but between two major careers. I wanted a baking bread for a year and had done that ten years ago. And so it's kind of been like that anyway cutting the vegetables and washing legs and figuring out slugs and all of that. I really loved it. Only as I reflect on it had a lot of meaning. And I know it just left me feeling very peaceful doing that. It was an interesting thing because we were assigned that job during the shortest walking period of the day. And so it invariably ran over. And the choice of it running over into this part of the city I felt really comfortable with because I felt attentive so attentive in there that I didn't feel like I was missing anything. And it was really nice today cleaning my room because I'm thinking about leaving tomorrow and using the afternoon bear awareness to do that. Bear attention time. I had an interesting experience. One of the things on my door was make sure you clean the mirror. And I've been shading in that mirror all week thinking it was relatively clean and I was cleaning it and. It. Was Lo and behold. I mean I was looking back at this face and the mirror was totally different than I'd been using all week. And it was kind of a special moment. It kind of really symbolized the part where had taken place. Did you see your toolpath? No but a cleaner ambition. The other thing is that work for me in everyday life has been I can't separate it at all from my spiritual life. I guess it might be partly because the thrust of my training has been to make that occur to be really conscious of that every day how it works itself how I unfollow by my job and in my job and I work in job calling me continually to pull resources out of myself that I'm not that are kind of late as it comes from the four very much like the example you gave of the woman in Cambridge. So I found it for the last ten or twelve years to be just a very special part of my life. One difference I found cutting the vegetables here and at home is that and I used to give great care to do it at home as well but less so recently is that my quality of attention in doing it was more refined here. And I thought well maybe it's partly because of time but there's more than that I think as well. I think it's just partly the attention I brought to it as well. There are ways in which work is dealt with for example in one way in which Japanese monasteries work which will give you a sense that some of this is coming up spontaneously here. One thing they'll do is all the monks rotate so that nobody has the same job all the time. And so some of the jobs are let's say nurturing jobs where you're let's say cooking helping people picking their spirits up if they're down and others where you have to play the tough guy and people are falling asleep in the meditation hall screaming at them or hitting them with a stick and you rotate through it including and some of the jobs are quite menial. In one of the best monasteries that I spent a little bit of time at even the Zen master was part of it. And you'd see a Zen master maybe a cleaning the toilet or you see them working out in the fields or is it totally integrated into the life? It's not superior or inferior. And for most of us that's a foreign idea. We have to overcome a lot of aversion. The lack of fulfillment. And work is something you do. You put your time in. And the whole point is to get out of work to get as much free time to do what you really want to do in the kitchen of this particular monastery which is a very traditional approach to cooking. They give a lot of instructions to the people who work in the kitchen to treat the food with the same care as you're preparing the food with the same care that you treat your eyes. And then it goes into instructions that the meals are quite uneven in these monasteries. That is if there's a lot of donations there might be a lot of good food and if not it'll be very simple meal or a lot of leftovers. And there the challenge is to bring the same quality of attention to the leftovers let's say a really ordinary meal compared to almost a banquet to really just ordinary leaves and a few little bit of rice. And it goes on like that. Life itself provides us with enough for those opportunities really but that's an interesting way to do it. Anyone have any reactions to the job situation finding an appropriate work right livelihood? That aspect of the talk. Was that relevant for anyone here? One thing that you mentioned that was really relevant for me was I reflected on four or five years ago when I first met you I was baking bread in a natural foods restaurant between just finishing a very kind of professional career so to speak and not ready to go onto the next one. And for a while in that job which I'd done before in another place well when I first took it I really relished it because I had to get up at 03:00 in the morning and I tried to do my sitting before that and then go off to this job because it was baking bread. It was a special thing for me. But then what happened was here I was in this very hustley bustly very popular restaurant in Cambridge right in Harvey Square and I would see a lot of people that were doing the work that I had done. People were therapists people that were educators. And here I was walking around in a white apron and sweating and eating bread all day. And I remember those distinct moments when I would feel very selfconscious because here I was in court doing this menial work in relationship to what they were doing and that's what was happening inside. And I remember really having to kind of really confront that and look at it and work with it and talk to my wife about it and really kind of come back to feeling this isn't what I was doing. And I had actually chosen to do it again and feeling good about it. And I can remember the kind of restlessness of that few week period when I did kind of want to go out to the front where everyone was and stayed in the back. So a lot of the problem was perhaps what you thought other people thought of you? Yeah exactly right. Like here I was this person with all this education had done all this particular stuff and now he was back in the kitchen eating bread and I had to recycle that whole process by doing this over again is just a cop out and blah blah blah blah blah until finally I could bring myself to it again in a good way. So it's very much what you were talking about in terms of rehabilitating oneself. Right. In that job. Anyone else relate to the whole right livelihood issue?

I've been in it for seven or eight years now. And one of the things that I realized is that even though I consider it ideal very often in past years I've suffered a lot at my job and it's been my own fault brought a lot of negativity and self doubt to work. And even with that I felt pretty good about it. But I've been thinking how much more fulfilling it can be if those factors are toned down minimized. How would you go about doing that? How can you apply what we've been learning here to your work situation? Well simply accepting all the various situations that come up in my work situation being there with them instead of resisting them. I'm a teacher so I see so many varied situations that I have my favorites and I have my ones that I would room my whole week. One class Black Tuesday and I see a certain group of people and I realize that is not necessarily Black Tuesday. If I could make a suggestion about that. It's come from a certain amount of experience that people have had in say work situations which push our buttons. Often people will think that they're being let's say these students come in and they push your button right? You're what offended or annoyed or whatever it is. People think that they're being aware of their work situation. What is really happening is after it's over or five minutes later or ten minutes later they're reviewing what's happened to them and they're saying boy I went in there and they did this and I felt terrible et cetera. But what we're trying to develop here our reflexes have to become very quick. And so as they push your button the awareness has to be right there with it in the moment that it happens. It's not to say that there isn't some value in reflecting on it afterwards. Sometimes that can be useful too. But if we don't develop that ability to meet the response in order there's an objective challenge. They come in and then you have a subjective reaction to it. An awareness has to be there right with it. If it does it doesn't take root. You feel the annoyance or the apprehension and the bottom falls out. I mean test it takes practice. It sometimes requires when that time comes you know they're about to come in in five minutes to form the intention to remain alert while they're knowing full well that they're going to push your buttons or have that impact on you and little by little learning how to be so supple with the application of awareness that we're with what's happening as it happens. Yeah the problem I have in those situations is that I have a predetermined setting of reactions which I'm assuming they're going to react in a certain way when they do like I have my plan but the plan is often not appropriate.", 'human_start_time': '0:57:07'}, {'talkname': '19830718-Larry_Rosenberg-UNK-contemplative_eating-1468', 'question_num': 'Question 1', 'url': '/talks/1468/19830718-Larry_Rosenberg-UNK-contemplative_eating-1468.mp3', 'display_name': 'Contemplative Eating', 'date': '7/18/83 0:00', 'start_time': 2730270, 'content': "Certain foods that tend to be addicted like chocolate. I almost find it easier not to have anything to just have a little and know end of stuff. Do you think through this process you can get to the point where you can just enjoy a little bit of something that's very addictive like that? I think that that's the point. I think you're really right on the target. It's much easier to fast than to eat intelligently. It's much easier to be silent the way we have been for a few days than for speech to be harmonious when we leave here blah blah blah. But this can help us do that. It can help us do that and fasting can help us learn how to eat correctly. So what you've put forward is that's it? I don't want to get involved in whether you should eat chocolate or eliminate it but let's say you have decided that you're going to then can you reach a way of deriving pleasure? And I would say there's a greed to which there's awareness. With the eating of the chocolate I would say that there's a better chance of you're not needing as much chocolate. Some of that is because you're eating sensations. If you notice there's something fulfilling about being aware of bodily sensations. It's a kind of food on a subtle level. When you really feel the body at work or when you really hear a thought or when you really experience an emotion in awareness it's very fulfilling. So you don't need in a sense a more gross kind of fulfillment. By extension. Of course as the practice gets stronger those kinds of cravings that are out of balance become less necessary or they can become less necessary because perhaps we're getting something that's closer to our true food.

But in my ordinary life I find it very difficult. There's an incredible difference between the two. Who makes that difference? My level of attention to what's going on if I don't have any willpower or not comes from my awareness of what you just described. You described it very well. If we're aware of respect and I've been overeating incorrectly for many years. And finally about 15 months ago my body just started to go down. It was extraordinary. It's never happening before. It wasn't very healthy. It showed me very clearly that effect. What's happening. But I'm wondering if you have any hints on what to do when we go home when we get on the plane to go home and what they put in front of you. But I'm sitting there going out to beating and hungry have to cross to kill. I don't have a recipe or technique except while you're here learn as much as you can or as deep in that capacity of attention. When we use the word attention here we don't mean just sort of a fixated gaze. It has discernment in it's attention with a willingness to learn and you have to do it. In other words you have to live your understanding. And when you betray your understanding find out why or don't club yourself over the head. Let's say you do beautifully here and you get on the plane and they put what they put on in front of you and you just die for it. And not only that you ask for seconds. Now some of it would be good if you can learn while you're going. But often these things happen too quickly. It's over and you've betrayed your understanding in a certain way. And then you feel guilty and we go through that cycle over and over again. But instead of doing that sort of run the movie backwards track it down in order. What were you feeling on the airplane just before the meal? Was it anxiety or fear or apprehension of where you're going or what was your mood? Is there something that precipitated made you vulnerable to grab something from the outside as a comforter? And if there is then go to that see where the practice is constantly pushing us towards the root of our problems. And perhaps the ultimate route is self cherishing.

It seems easier in one way is to stay with me completely. And yet when I do that. Okay well you've at least identified your predicament. For example take the overeating thing. I was brought up that at the end of the meal particularly men if you weren't as you put it exactly or if you weren't bulging at the seams that was a sense of wellbeing and often certain sounds also had to come out to confirm this sense of well being. And this rewarded the Cook. The Cook felt good and you felt good as you toddled away from your chair or crawled away from your chair. So on one level and perhaps I try to trace this out with my parents and with relatives I think it comes often there's hunger in that background people have known actual hunger which begets a pattern that is no longer functional in the United States. It's not necessary. Most of us have food adequate food but so there's a psychological well being and the body pays for it. Now the whole point of spiritual practice is suggesting that the ways in which we've been trying to get fulfillment don't work. We're never going to get it from a meal. I mean there's some fulfillment you can enjoy a meal but there's no ultimate fulfillment in a meal obviously and yet we're trying to get it so we're not going towards where it may be possible and that's what all the spiritual traditions are about. Now some of them set up an opposition where it makes so often we don't know how to use the energy of food of sex of money. So we have to just stop it cut it off regulate how we eat become celibate not handle money and that's one solution to the problem simplify it and keep those stressors out because we know if they're let in we're vulnerable and we'll just fall apart. So we just regulate it. We build a fence around ourselves and that's one strategy it's often the strategy used in monastic situations it can be quite useful but most of us are not going to be taking that path so we need a different path. We're in the world we do eat we have money sex et cetera. So we have to really learn how to use those energies and then we get caught back and forth in the way you're describing the way all of us are. Trying to cut myself off of. I can't imagine being people. Okay see I'm not saying eliminate sugar it's for each person to decide how to eat. This is not some kind of food moralism a natural health puritanism but it's really it should be on your terms.

You'Ll see as we go on A very important reflection is that the amount of time spent during our life to develop the mind is really rather small. Please remember in the teachings of the Buddha death is not cessation or termination but actually transition whether you believe that or not. For the moment consider it. And so when the body dies in this teaching there's a mental continuum. The traces the residue of the virtuous and the cruel actions that we've done is with us. We bring our Karma with us so the mind doesn't end even though the body does. And so what is it that we take away from this life? It's only what we've developed in the mind. Everything else in terms of the bodies we leave behind. And if you look even in a few moments here a kind of casual inventory. How much of our days spent eating sleeping getting caught up in certain moods? How much time do we spend cultivating the mind? The mind here includes the heart. Often we find when we do this kind of inventory very little. Even though that's what we take with us. We seem to give much more time and attention to things that are transitory accumulations that need to be left behind. Not only is death inevitable it's also uncertain. Although we know that we will all die we don't know when we don't know where. We don't know how. Some beings die in an embryonic form some die at birth some die in bed in 90s or 100 years old. Probably for most people it comes as a surprise. When it comes the challenge for the contemplation here would be to generate a strong feeling of complete uncertainty. As you know this is central to the Buddhist teaching. Coming from impermanence things are uncertain. This is just one more example of that principle. We're not really in control. Something much bigger than us is happening. We're part of it and it's uncertain. If you can feel that uncertainty. And. Stay with the feeling stay with that sense of it an inner conviction. If not hear the words and let them operate on you. So we don't know when we're going to die. We don't know what will cause our death. Seemingly indefinite numbers of causes earthquakes car accidents any number of illnesses wars diseases alone are so many and anyone can do it. Any one of these causes is enough. One reason there are so many causes is because the body is so fragile so dependent on the right combinations of heat and cold and food posture movement skin covering very delicate alive set of organs all working together. A person can go in a matter of moments from being very strong and hearty seemingly indestructible to being very sick and dying. I have a couple of friends who had an experience that brings everything together. They're on a picnic in Australia in the woods. They're two children and they left the children underneath a tree for just about half an hour. Both parents went to get something told them to wait there. When they came back both children were in the process of dying from poisonous mushrooms that they ate. They both died. Everything I've said so far I hope is useful in terms of the futility of attachment it simply doesn't work. And all of the reflections that have been mentioned help us to develop determination help us order our lives to determine what we truly value and to pursue it to begin to practice in a sincere way right now perhaps to vacillate and hesitate and postpone retreats that we say we want to do et cetera. Perhaps it helps us to really practice the only time we can practice right now. We move from the uncertainty of the time of death finally into a set of considerations having to do with the fact that only insight into the Dharma the insight that we're developing can help us at the time of death. When you have more time at home when you move into this segment what you can do is visualize yourself dying how it would be with the people around you that might very well be around you and you being in a condition where you're very close to death in an imaginative way feeling very little energy breath not flowing freely perhaps helpless sense of helplessness reflection has to do with at this point the only thing that can help is the wisdom. The practice that we've developed. Our possessions are useless. They won't help no matter how hard we've worked to accumulate homes and clothing cars. At this point we have to leave it behind all of it. We have to leave the people that we love and who love us behind each and every one of them. There's nothing that they can do for us at that moment and this is true for everyone. If you get attached to any one of these things the process of dying becomes torturous. The struggle to maintain the grasp which is hopeless makes it impossible to die at peace makes everything worse for ourselves and whoever is there. The degree to which our practice has developed is the degree to which this situation becomes workable. And having understanding of this sort about the problem of attachment when we're dying can be very useful in looking at our attachments now because it's just as true now. And so it's an attempt to help us re educate ourselves slowly and gradually with the help of the practice so that we're in alignment with the way things are. Of course finally even our body can't help. We've done so much for it. A lifetime of caring for it feeding it exercising it cleaning it dressing it. It served us so well in many respects. And so according to the teaching at this point we have to leave everything behind except who we are. The inner development the inner work that we've carried out is not wasted. The death of the body is just the death of the body. The mind stream continues to unfold evolve. What helps at that point? Qualities like mindfulness compassion patience love. And. Of course how we've lived our life. Unfinished business with other people perhaps things we've done to accrue wealth or power or prestige that eat away at us. Now. It'd be nice if we can die feeling fulfilled. So one lesson that comes out of this reflection as we bring it to a close which can come out of an examination of the process of dying. Is that we use a tremendous amount of time effort energy money to develop and accumulate things which we have to let go of. And we use very little of our time and energy to develop that which remains with us. Spiritual qualities aren't lost. The rest is you needn't see it that way. It's just something to consider. For me part of the beauty of our practice is not simply the obvious value of sitting and walking and retreats and so forth. But the very way in which the practice is conceived. Being mindful all the time learning all the time enables us to develop the practice in the midst of our life as we live our normal life. And so sometimes a reflection on death and stripping away so many things. And. Giving power to other things can be very useful for our journey. And that's why we do it. Likes include with a please keep staying in a meditative mode. With a few sample of lines from the fifth Dalai Lama's meditation on the ways of impermanence. He starts it off to the Lama Ilha. That is to his teacher my refuge. My father the recollection of whom dispels all sadness. I turn for spiritual guidance. Bless my mind with your transforming powers. That the thought of death may never evade me. That I may practice the Holy Dharma perfectly. You can see from this person's point of view he's asking for help so that he doesn't forget death. Where so much of what we're all doing is to forget death. And then he proceeds. And I'll give you just a taste of some of the things he touches upon. To use everything that happens to bring him back to an understanding of this theme. In spring the season of warmth and growth. The stalks of the crops were turquoise green. Now autumn's end. The fields lie naked and parched. My mind turns to the thoughts of my death. Please remember that this is not a morbid preoccupation on each branch of the trees in my garden. And clusters of fruit swelling and ripe. In the end not one piece will remain. My mind turns to the thoughts of my death. In the belly of the vast Plateau below me the campfires of visiting traders glow like stars. But tomorrow they depart. Leaving only refuse. My mind turns the thoughts of my death. From very birth. A child sees his parents age sees them each day come closer to the grave. How can you say to me? But I am still young. I warn you there is no hope of hiding from death. Spirits were high with expectations this morning as the men discussed subduing enemies and protecting the land. Now with nights coming birds and dogs chew their corpses who believed that they themselves would die. Today if you look closely at and contemplate deeply the people and things that appear around you you can see that all are in constant flux. Everything becomes a teacher of impermanence. In order to die well with the joy and confidence of being within the white rays of spiritual awareness it is essential to begin reading yourself now familiarize yourself with the profundities of the teachings. A few notes on practice few hints on practice. Although as you look at this outline it's systematic and methodical and you can work with it that way. For example take one a day. I wouldn't spend too much time on it. Come to some calm and perhaps spend you'll know but let's say 20 minutes. Don't overdo it. And whichever one you're working on let's say if you're doing the first one go into that with some depth. And then when you finish skim the others so that they are part of what you learn. But as you go on you may find that the creative process takes you to someplace that isn't present in this methodical systematic arrangement. You may find that a particular reflection really is a key to something. It opens you up. In my own case I'm not telling you to do this. I'm just suggesting I started off with a very methodical practice and kept coming back to just a skeleton. It would just come up spontaneously. And so when I reflect on death for the most part that's what I do. I just have access to it. A skeleton comes up my own others and it's very helpful. Now I've dropped all the rest of it simply because this is fruitful. So there's no virtue in kind of sticking to it just for its own sake. The key thing is that it opens you up to this sense of what we are talking about all evening. And that more and more it becomes real and you become comfortable with it. Now the fruit is often not experienced during the sitting or when you're practicing. But later on when you start to feel less attached to certain things more balanced less excitable less hysterical kinder to other people it softens the heart. You start to reflect that all of us are going through this. How can you be mean to anyone? It's kind of hard to do. It gets harder to be selfish and so forth. At any rate my suggestion is that if you feel genuinely drawn to this then work with it in your own way from time to time. If you don't trust that just drop it. Just see it as some information that you got tonight at this strange place 331 Broadway. And maybe in the future it'll be helpful and maybe not. I wish you luck in terms of getting out of this thing alive. Any questions? I know we've gone a little late but if there is anything on your mind strongly. I'd like to deal with if anyone's upset or anything of that sort. For example. Yeah.", 'human_start_time': '0:50:33'}, {'talkname': '19891122-Larry_Rosenberg-UNK-marana_sati_deathmindedness-1570', 'question_num': 'Question 2', 'url': '/talks/1570/19891122-Larry_Rosenberg-UNK-marana_sati_deathmindedness-1570.mp3', 'display_name': 'Marana Sati: Deathmindedness', 'date': '11/22/89 0:00', 'start_time': 4711232, 'content': "You seem to have developed some conviction. Around which I would like to do. Around this idea that. You develop conviction in this area. You're talking rebirth right? Did we exist before? Yeah. As you know it's not required that you believe that. And many people in the west don't. I myself don't really care if a person believes in it or not because for myself what I learned is that even if we're not true let's say that there is no never existed before. And when I die that's it. I would still keep doing this practice because it helps me live. Now see the major death. I'm coming about it indirectly. I'll give you a few of the reasons which are not the reasons. But finally the conviction is just there. You could see limits in that. One is having studied this practice various forms of the Buddhist teaching for many years at least for me over 20 years. Whatever I've tested has proven to be beneficial for me. And I hope it is for you. So I've developed a lot of trust in the Buddha. So why would he lie? Why would he lie about this? Since it's central to the teaching over and over again. And it isn't just the Buddha. There are excuse me others now. I've had psychic flashes drug experiences. I've had psychics telling me and all that probably could be explained in other ways genetically. And who knows how. I've had some experience for past lifetimes which is very convincing for me. This helps me answer your question because if I lived before then I might live again. When I first opened up to all these things I seem to know a lot about it. And I had done no reading on this at all. And I mean zero. I had a typical academic scientific intellectual literary background. And suddenly I had an experience of a certain kind. And after that experience stuff was just coming. I didn't know where I knew it. I didn't feel entitled to know it. I felt sometimes very strange. But the words would come out and then I would check with books and it seemed okay. It was very weird at first. I grew to accept it to understand that. But maybe this and this is really important. I know it's gone long but if I leave this out we'll be getting I think not the deepest understanding of what this is all about. The death of the body in this teaching is not the most important thing. That is in Zen they talk about the great death. That's the real important death. I'm just going to say what the teaching says. The really important death is not the death of the body. It's the death of the ego. It's the death of me and mine. And that is as long as that keeps being alive whether you see it in past lifetimes and future lifetimes or whether you see it from moment to moment that is me and mine is born and then it subsides and it's born and it subsides. That is to say that this habit of selfing claims things as being mine or claims things as being me. There's a gap and we don't do it and then we do it again and we don't do it. I mean just during a typical day maybe hundreds of thousands of times the eye is born and dies in moments momentariness. And that's the problem. The root of the problem is that the suffering comes out of that. So that what the teachings are saying is that what the path leads to is what is called a deathless state. The deathless state or it's sometimes called the unborn or sometimes called Nirvana or sometimes called the unconditioned. Now that's what this is about really. Finally that's what it is about. That is each one of us is already partaking of that just that we don't know it. It's not something that we acquire. It's something that when we clear away everything that's obscuring it we come to know what we all along have been. But if you want to be Larry being there at the time to notice it you're not going to get there because Larry is the problem for me. I hope he's not. Maybe for you too. He's definitely my biggest problem in life. So that the important. Death. The thing about being reborn and getting a good rebirth and not such a good rebirth. That's not the highest teaching. Okay that goes on but it's still part of the same game. It's still constantly the ego to getting someplace where it has a better condition or worse condition. But what the teaching is about is shedding the whole thing. Now that can happen at any time. In fact all you need is one life. Now according to the teaching most of us don't do it. Maybe no one does it. So we have many lives and we learn in one way which it's been conceived of in Buddhism is that we learn different lessons in different lifetimes. The past lives of the Buddha whether they're a myth or propaganda or delusion. But they are interesting because they point out different qualities that were developed in previous lifetimes. Sometimes many lifetimes used to develop a certain patience or generosity or compassion or mindfulness or honesty whatever it is. Now there are other reasons. I don't know if any of this will be convincing to you. It seems to me absurd to think that we work so hard on ourselves that the human with such incredible potential for human beings to go very low to become an Ottof Hitler or Stalin. And the other possibilities which are just to become totally free. It's quite extraordinary. I think it is. It seems to me makes no sense that you just live and then suddenly your body dies and that's the end of it. That it's. All your hard work on yourself. Just one big joke. The universe is just a big joke now. Something that was very helpful for me many years ago is there were people who were dying in Czechoslovakia and they were lifetime communists. They had been conditioned. They were atheists did not believe in God were party members. And when they died when they were dying they were willing to take LSD and they took LSD and some didn't and had this experience and they had incredible religious experiences full of they saw whatever. It had nothing to do with their conditioning because their conditioning was totally anti religious. They came upon something that has nothing to do with conditioning. Not images or seeing Angels or anything of that sort. They came to something that is beyond words and pictures and it's beyond the mind. They came to reading it genuine religious experiences and they had no preparation for it. In fact they were conditioned in their life to be totally opposed. Obstacles incredible obstacles. Marxist ideology is a big barrier. And so it always struck me as of course it's a human thing it's the law. It has nothing to do with what we human beings make up. We'll spin out ideologies to a blue in the face new ones just thoughts ways of organizing things. But this is beyond ideology. Even Buddhism. It's beyond Buddhism. The Buddhist says that. It says none of my verbal. They're teaching words. They're not absolutely true. How could they be? They're just words. So finally the only way you have to know we have to know for ourselves. So I myself am not so preoccupied with living again and again and again. You see really that's the ego still the ego really wants to hear and say you mean I'm not going to die? After this is over I can still go see more movies and make love more times and have more delicious meals. Yes be a good boy be a good girl. You get a nice rebirth. Oh great. That to me has never been a real stir. To be on the path. What it is is to be free. And so in a sense that's outside of time and bodies and all the rest of it yet you have to do it in time. So some of it is based on trust on the Buddha and other teachers who I've had. I don't believe Mahabou would lie to me. I mean I just trust him. I don't think Krishna Murdy would lie to me now. They could be deluded Buddha could be diluted. So finally you're going to have to make a choice for yourself. Just believing in it is so what? My faith is not going to help you. And the faith is mainly of value so that it keeps us practicing so that we can verify it directly with our experience. So we don't have to rely on mere faith but it's palpable something that's really as real as whatever you think is real. What was your reaction to this? I even hesitated doing it in a group of this sort. But I feel it's an important something or other to think about. And I tried to be careful because if somebody's very upset I'm not interested in pushing anyone into very bad feelings. Anybody have any reaction to it? That is something that shouldn't be done or should be done. It's okay to do. I'm asking for some feedback what we call feedback. Yeah. I thought it was very rewarding. I don't know how to describe except that it's my first introduction to it and I'm glad I came back. Okay. The last time I gave it a person got up in the middle was ringing wet and just practically ran out. And I spoke to him later on. He was just terrified. And I'm not trying to do that. And yet it's a very important question maybe the most important and we have to deal with it. So how else can we do it except by calling it what it is?

It can help you with letting go a lot. It's not just at the time of death. The time of death is really dramatic. You see that you don't own anything but nothing belongs to you. It never did. And so it just stands out. And so sometimes when you do that reflection it becomes easier to have a loose relationship not caring whether it's relationship with a person or your job. It has nothing to do with that. It's more using those things as occasions to develop self. And so if it helps you let go then it's done its job. If it helps you wake up tomorrow morning and come and sit or go and sit wherever you live it's done its job. If it helps you reflect on how you're using this precious life how you use your time and energy and you see areas that are futile that you do anyway just really silly uses of your own precious life force.

Okay. There's water. There's this it's looking at all the other things that are going on but in the end of saying So what? So what you come back for? Can we roll the movie back? Yeah. Let's go to where you said a dryness stop right there. Full stop period. Don't go any further. Be mindful of dryness. See the practice is very gentle but it's ruthless. There's nothing that you could tell me. I'm going to say the same thing. Your present moment has dryness in it. Now the human mind wants something juicy. It wants it to be moist. So it's a problem. And now you got your problem and now you're trying to give it to me and I don't want it. Dryness is exactly what your practice is. Unwanted messy and then we can get into. Oh well if I were doing the practice right this isn't a distraction. If it weren't so dry I'd really be much more excited about the practice. But the power of the practice is to begin with you are being asked to look at things you don't want to look at. And it takes some doing to do that because it's going against the grain. We just want to be comfortable. We want to feel good. We want to do something and get a reward for it. And here I know you practice and here's dryness. Now has it been dry 100% of the time since you started practicing? No it hasn't. Of course not. You wouldn't be here. Right. There's so many things that like you say that come up that you don't want to look at. Yes. And I see them over and over. And even when I come back. Okay just walk. Go ahead. Just walk. Where's the light? Where's the joy? Where is it? Okay. But you see. Can I back up? Yeah. Okay. Over and over again you have time is also on a micro level not just macro level. Micro level in other words. Okay. I've been doing walking meditation or walking for seven minutes. It should be juicy by now. Who said in other words you have a notion of and then you have a memory of that. You've been walking just so long and maybe you bring into your file of all the walkings you've done and before you know it you're back in like that one week without sleep. I don't know if I'm being clear now. The other thing is let's say you strongly don't want to look at dryness. I'm just going to use that to represent all the unwanted stuff that we humans don't want to look at. It's all of us. It's not that you have to rub your face in it. It's not that kind of you get that into that dryness and then you let me know what happens. It's not that at all. It's gentle so that there's dryness. And then the next moment is the mind thinks of well the Buddha said that that is the practice dryness. And then you feel like look I don't want to practice with dryness. Where's all the joy? Well that's your yearning. That's what you want. The future. See you're expecting a better future if you do this stuff. That's what I was talking about. If I do enough of this sitting walking meditating eat vegetables don't hurt anyone then it's going to be what were yours joy and all that lights going off visions Saints coming to visit you. And some time in the future it's going to be a much better life. But the practice is about how is it right now? Now this requires faith to begin with because it's asking you to do something in a way that's counterintuitive. Why should I want to be with something that's dry and uninteresting? Because we're conditioned to go towards what makes us happy and to go away from what hurts us. That's sane. There's nothing wrong with that. We're trying to break new ground which goes beyond plus and minus. We're obsessed with plus all day long. Get the best seat on the T wherever we are. Get this get that accumulated at least sometimes if we can learn to look at that what you're going to find. So what you would look at is the resistance not the dryness you would see. My goodness you could feel the muscles tighten up. How much? I don't want to do this. I don't care what the Buddhist said. You feel the jaw tighten up and then that spreads to I'm no good. The meditation doesn't work. What does Larry know anyway? He's from Brooklyn. He's not from India. And before you know it you're out of here. And probably more people have been out of here who came here than are here. Turnover is very enormous in meditation circles apparently in Europe as well. Oh yeah and people have a romantic idea they're going. And if you don't get fully and totally enlightened and liberated in five years then you go to something else. A few people stick it out. Everyone's journey is different but that's where faith does come in. But you do need some verification. It's not just to live off of faith but do you see what I'm getting at? That's the beauty of this Sutra because it's pointing out it's a radically different way of relating to your experience to be fully with it in the moment as it's happening with no preferences. If it's dry then that dryness. Unwanted as it is those are the perfect materials to practice with. Nothing missing. Perfect. Because think of all the energy that's trapped in the dryness and in your resistance to the dryness. And then you're yearning for some imaginary beautiful joyful. Whatever it is. I don't remember all your words. Everything the New Age promises. Picture all the energy in that. And if we can go through it and allow that's being held to release itself that energy is yours. Then to do with it as you see fit. Does that make sense? Good. Now you got to do it.

Even if you think you're living in the future you're just extrapolating from the past and imagining what you think would happen based on what you've already. Yeah that's true. But all that's happening in the present. Yes. So the person is partially correct. But I'm not the Pope of meditation so it's just my opinion. If you can find a past that exists in an autonomous way show it to me. There are memories of it. They're recorded books that tell us what when. And I'm not saying that's worthless. Not at all. But it's more a matter of how do we relate to what is over with in our own personal life or in the history of a particular ethnic group or your family. I'm not saying that's worthless. Not at all. But you have to see how that works in terms of what contribution or lack of or harm it's causing in the actual life which is only lived in the present moment aliveness can only be experienced here and now. Then everything after that is memory or imagination. But your friend is correct. The future we imagine is based on what's already happened and it will never be like that. For example in meditation people are often frightened of the unknown. Silence. Once you taste it it's nothing to be frightened of. It's a glorious gift from life. But our mind is. First of all we're so stuck in thinking past future even about the present that anything that's other than thought. And by thought I mean images emotions mental productions fabrications they're called. First of all we don't know what exists. The unknown is simply that realm of consciousness where we haven't been to yet. Our culture is not recognized that as anything valid to want to get to other cultures have the ancients in our culture knew about it.

And a young guy from California was in his presence. Yes. And I thought it was kind of interesting and instructive story but I didn't quite get it. Okay. So my question was and maybe you want to recount the story because you probably know it. We can do it better than I but what's the difference between you being there and he being there in spite of all this turmoil about him following his heart? Yes. The story was this was in a forest monastery in Thailand with Ajan Mahabua. His style is take no prisoners. If you want a new Age style don't go to his wife. He's actually a wonderful teacher. Could be a stand up comic. Also Green Beret. I mean you never know what he's going to be from moment to moment and that's part of it. For example when you meditate there each. One of us you get a hut in the jungle. They call it forest tradition. It's not a forest forest. You go to picnics. This is a jungle. Snakes. Everything is there. It should be the Thai jungle tradition anyway but forest sounds nice. Okay so you're in a hut and all the huts are separated from each other. All the different yogis are separated with interconnecting paths. You can't see the neighboring huts but they're connected by paths and then to a main area where there's a big hall and where Arjun Mahabua and other monks live and so forth. And you're just on your own. Sometimes you come together for group practice. He will make his way his rounds just to give you a sense of. The guy who was talking and peek into the hut. If you're sleeping at any time of day or night he puts a chalk. Mark and he said he learned this from Americans. He said three strikes and you're out. And if he finds you sleeping three times he asks you to leave the monastery. Now it's random. You don't know when he's going to turn up. So there could be some sleepy heads who are getting through the radar. And there could be some people who just happen to be asleep three times and they're mostly away out. So this is the kind of guy he's a very fine teacher. So this person rather new to the practice shows up from California. I don't know who the kid was. But 22 looks like if he wasn't. A surfer he should be. Or he would get the role of a surfer in a surfing movie. And he makes some kind of comment about how do you know what to do how to act? And he says what did I say? He said I want your words. I follow my heart. I look into my heart follow my heart. Sounds good. Sounds very New Age. It actually sounds practical too. What else are you going to get? And Mahabula couldn't understand it. He had to have it translated four or five times. Finally he rolled over laughing and he just said you follow what's in the heart? He says that cesspool full of urine and feces like bad information and stupidities. He couldn't control. He just kept laughing. So what do I do? It's not I. What would the practice be? Of course you always have to work with what you have don't you? So that you can't wait until you're perfect and what never act until you have this clear mind that I just talked about that's radiant and just knows exactly what to do. It's always wise and kind. Of course not much of how you get to that heart is through foolish behavior. The question is whether you learn from your foolishness or you just keep repeating it over and over and over again. So that's why Dharma teachings exist at first because they're just words but they're pointers in the right direction. So let's say you see a sign New York. It isn't New York but it helps you get to New York. So it's helpful. Let's say if you've never been to New York and you don't know the roads New York 22 miles. It's nice to see that it's friendly and helpful. Otherwise you're figuring out how to get there. So Dharma teachings are in a sense guiding us how to live. And the Buddha gave very precise instructions. It's actually a question that I'm going to have to give. Does the Reader's Digest still exist? Kind of short version of what the Buddhist suggested is that you take teachings from the various teachers because people are getting confused. All the different teachers have different teachings and don't believe it just because it's ancient because it's from a great text or your teacher has a long beard or whatever it is try test it. Live with it and see if it is beneficial. If it produces harm it doesn't really help you live then drop it. If you see that it's helpful and. Beneficial for you and for others then keep doing it. So it's a kind of you are given some guidance. That's what's called Dharma teachings. They're guidelines pointers. Now some of that is because the heart on its own is tremendously driven by greed hatred and delusion. So there are verbal teachings. There are teachers who are to the degree to which they have clarified their own lives are all trying to help you live as best as you can. But finally the best thing you can do Is to clean up that heart Because then you'll see for yourself. And as you practice it should become easier to live. To me meditation is finally about one. It's an explosion of love. And if you're not feeling a little more if you've been doing this practice for a while and you're not feeling that there is more love in your. Life Find out why are you doing the practice correctly? Or maybe it's the wrong practice for you. I don't know what. So you do the best you can with the help that is available. But more and more you're not as needy of verbal teachings and physical teachers. Because finally the whole point of the Buddhist teaching. At his death he says be a lamp unto yourself be a light unto yourself. It's to teach us to stand on our own. 2ft to take responsibility for our own happiness and unhappiness. It's not going to come from up. Above in this teaching. The California guy following his own heart Is sort of the opposite of the Sanka. Yes you could say that but he's just normal. Everyone's doing that. They're following their own heart. It's just he had an eloquent way of putting it. The mechanics were just happening. There's not much examination or reflection on why we're behaving the way we are now and then we do it and that's. Look at the world. That's the way it looks. I don't want to talk ourselves. Any questions about what's been said before we start to actually sit. So a lot of what's been said you won't be directly able to test it so much here. Because this isn't strongly a relationship kind of retreat. There's some. But when you go home you can. And during the question and answer discussion period. If you have questions about how to apply relationship as a mirror in your daily life that would be fine Because I have found it to be something practical and very helpful. It might be a good idea to stretch move before we sit.", 'human_start_time': '0:37:19'}, {'talkname': '20080312-Larry_Rosenberg-CIMC-self_knowing_a_quiet_passion_part_33-35548', 'question_num': 'Question 1', 'url': '/talks/35548/20080312-Larry_Rosenberg-CIMC-self_knowing_a_quiet_passion_part_33-35548.mp3', 'display_name': 'Self Knowing: A Quiet Passion Part 33', 'date': '3/12/08 19:00', 'start_time': 3725550, 'content': "There's something I'm curious about. It goes back to the very beginning of a book you wrote and it might not be appropriate for you to talk about. Just ask it. Okay. You got a long wind up here. You told about having a teacher who you didn't identify because he didn't want to be identified. Oh yes. And he woke you up in the middle of the night and brought you to a place where there was a. Person who had just dropped a corpse who had been discovered after being dead for about ten days. Yes. And you stated that that was considered to meditate with the course was considered a very valuable practice. No question about it. In that culture. In that culture for humans. I'm curious about. Why that's considered such a valuable practice. What do you think? It might be of some value be me for the moment. Give me a break so I don't have to talk so much. Well I think all of us are aging. Exactly. And all of us are going to die. Exactly. And I think the root of all my fear comes from that. Bingo. You just won nothing. Yes. For example look the last thing I ever want to do is look at a book I wrote. I'd never read them after they're done if I can help it. What this teacher did with me is he woke me up in the middle of the night and said he was incredibly excited. A corpse had been found and the local villagers it was washed up. He had been drunk and died. And the local villagers couldn't touch it because he was from another religion or I don't know some idiocy. And there was a priest coming from another village in the morning. And when he came there he could officiate and do the right religious things and they could bring him back to the village he was from. And then they could have a proper burial. And since we were outsiders would we mind? He was packed in ice and he was bloated and bluish. And suddenly I'm awakened and this teacher was ecstatic with the good news. Okay. And I figured you can imagine how I felt. Okay. So I'm sitting there and what did we do? All we did was we'd sit and he said Just be with this. And he said well what should I do? He said he didn't give me much help. And then periodically he'd say what are you feeling right now? I'd say on the edge of throwing up he said Be aware of that repulsion the smell et cetera. So what he was trying to do is to get me to be at home with and fear definitely came up with those fears so that I could either weaken them and maybe there are some human beings who are done with it and they know that dying is as natural as being born. Of course you're going to die. Why are we playing this game in our head? Because the main reason the teachings are given is so that we most people are interested in their life after death. That's fascinating to people I found. And what I find much more fascinating is their life before death meaning us what it can do. And this is what the Buddha intended. One of the things he intended is to help you understand you don't have forever. You will die. And so what it can serve to do it did for me is you start to realize the people in your life how precious they are life itself. How precious is that's? A teacher. The corpse is teaching it's saying you don't have for everybody. And without words anyone who dies is giving you a darn a lesson if you're open to learn it. But what he was trying to do is to flush out certain obvious fears that he knew I had. And it was a big help. But you got it on your own. Yeah. See you don't need teachers for everything.

Have you read that? No I haven't but I know Mark but I have not read the book. Okay. I love that book. The thrust of it for me is. What'S the title again? Thoughts without a Finger. Yes. And I forget the subtitle. That's okay. I know what he was doing but. It'S basically like acts as a corrective to the Western minds and misappropriation of Buddhist or Eastern wisdom to the Western mindset. And take for example people that have psychological problems in the west. They might misappropriate a Buddhist notion of detachment of self and think that well if there's no self then I have no problems. And so their way of running away from their problems is to have a noself. Yeah. But you see to me I guess. It'S a delicate balance. One of the things he mentioned is that people in the Eastern wisdom of detachment from self it presumes a strong ego construct to begin with. But if someone has a tattered and smashed very delicate or fragile self eco self construct then it could be very the tendency to misappropriate. Yeah. May I ask you something? Yeah. How has that helped you? The book or obviously it's favorable. How has it helped you? Well because I look at my own line and I see obviously I'm bringing this question up because it means something to me. That's what I want to find out. But you're going to have to be very concrete. See because so far it's been Eastern Western culture. It's a little bit. Let's get in closer. Your mind how has that book helped you with your thought process? If I think for instance I have not had a strong self ego construct growing up like if I had a hard childhood growing up and so I had a fragile ego not a strong ego then if I wanted to escape from my problems the notion of self detachment has an allure to me that I can escape my own problems by just saying I have a no sell. Yes. Okay let me translate. No you're getting closer. You're getting closer. But I don't know if you see what you think. I'd like to get us even closer. Okay. As a practice what I would take what you're saying is first of all I wouldn't use the word detachment but non attachment. Yeah it's okay. Detachment implies a pulling away from it looking from a distance safe. Maybe we begin that way. But nonattachment. And what real awareness is is not a pulling away from but an opening up to only not grasping or pushing away. It's intimate. Now your use of appropriating let's say I'm going to translate that. I think it's a good word for it. The thoughts are going through the mind. Okay. Some of what you said to me it's an idea about ego strength and all that. But the fact that I have a simpler way. There's a car here. Many of you have heard me say this over and over because I'm so impressed by it. There's a car with a bumper sticker on that street. If you go home that way and it says don't believe everything you think. And if that person really practiced that not just felt good about having that thought and then agreeing with them getting teary eyed and then sharing it with other people. But really as thoughts come through the mind no matter what they are see that they are just thoughts then you can add Buddhist jargon. It's empty. And that when you look at a thought it has no power at all. It's like a poor homeless creature. It comes out of nowhere. It goes back to nowhere. If you identify with it appropriate it you give it tremendous power over you. It's something like this. There's ancient Chinese teaching story where the greatest Dragon painter in ancient China he was improving all the time. He could really paint Dragons which are kind of a mythical animal in ancient times. And he got really good and he did his masterpiece in his studio. And then he went home and he came back in the morning and he ran out screaming with terror that a real Dragon was there. All it was was his best job. He had created such a good Dragon that he believed in it as being a real Dragon. So good you can go home now. Everyone else you got more practices call for you're done free. You don't have to waste any time or money here. Do you see what I'm getting at? And yet there's a time when thought is useful. So some of the skill is when is thinking useful and when isn't it? But let's just take ordinary meditation practice. Most people at some point have some difficulty. Just stay with the breath. There's some settings where you can't even find the nostrils let alone the breath. And you get discouraged. And there's a thought. This is not for you. Everyone else in the hall is doing well. They're calm. This is impossible. Why are you wasting your time? Your mind is entirely too wild. You started too late. You're too old. You're too this endless. If you believe in those thoughts if you believe impossible then you might as well go home because you've undermined yourself. But if you see it as thoughts they're just thoughts. In other words don't make difficult and don't make easy. Don't make anything. Just see it as blah blah blah blah. It's like skyriding eat at Joe's restaurant. They don't have sky gorilla milk which is. And then if you appropriate it which is a very good word you identify with it. You give it the energy. It's just a thought. But once you give it that energy you have created a Dragon that frightens you out of your own studio. You made up the whole thing. So we're learning how to liberate ourselves from our own mind. It's kind of hilarious when you look at it that way. Do you see what I'm getting at? And I think Mark probably does get it. Sounds good. Anyone else please? What about emotions? Yes but this isn't about saying. It's about. Let's say emotions is just a word right? Give me an emotion that is very real to you. Okay let's just stay with that. It's a big one for all of us. But it's not fear. That's just a word. But let's say you have to use it to communicate so we can all get a rough sense of what you're talking about. And then let's say fear turns up. That's an actual occurrence in nature in you. You can feel it in the body. You can feel the fear move through the body. You can fear to affect the pulse the heart the breathing and maybe subtle more subtle mind stuff. That's what you'd be aware of. Now it used to be. This is an overgeneralization. And I had a woman teacher named Vimla Takar from India and she found this to be true especially of highly educated Western women. No this is Indian women. Here's the point. Often women had a harder time being aware of emotion. Men had a harder time being aware of thinking because women were more emotional and men were more conceptual. But that's starting to change as women get more education and men are told it's okay to cry. Big boys can cry. So we're all opening up to where we've been shut down to some degree. But whatever it is each individual what we call an emotion fear is energy. Where's the energy guy? Over there. Oh you're somewhere else. Hello? Coming in for a oh you are here. Okay. You looked very deeply. And were you somewhere else? Oh I apologize. Okay so that's an occurrence. So that let's say in this method when awareness gets very steady And let's say fear comes up to begin with no one wants to observe fear. That's what I meant. And it would be let's get out of here. But then you get encouraged to. Well that's first novel truth that's suffering when we're afraid typically we are suffering because what we're attached to is not having the fear. We don't want to feel that. And so what we might look at is then the strength of how much we don't want to look at it. It's not that you rub your face into fear. But little by little like anything else you can learn to approach fear face to face. Get to know it and you realize it's a play of energy and it arises. It passes away like the Dragon. And then it's gone. And you see it's an impermanent empty phenomenon. Empty means it's not that substantial. But when there's no wisdom it's very powerful and it's as if it's a mountain and it's going to be there forever. And then it has its effect. With wisdom we see it isn't a mountain. It isn't going to be there forever. It isn't as solid as we've made it into. Do you see what I'm getting at? And so it's the same practice that would appear in the Sutra in the third set of contemplations Where if emotions are there that's what you're aware of. If thoughts are there that's what you're aware of. Often there's an interplay. Thoughts beget emotions. Emotions beget thoughts affect the body. It's all one being. Does that make sense to you? That's a relief. But that's not getting to the root of the problem. For example years ago that we used to with anger I went on one retreat. These are new age stuff. I remember with a baseball bat pounding a mattress. You the sound of it was my Army Sergeant. Sergeant spade. He was a terrific anti Semite. He made my life miserable for six months cursing. And this other person in big sur California. Let them have it. Kill that. It felt better.

I just don't like my physical sense of myself right now. It doesn't suit me. It's not quite imbalanced the way I would like it to be. Does it have an image as well? No. Never were. The reason I was laughing Vicky not at you is just. It reminded me of something that someone reported to this question in a different group different contexts. If I can remember it it had to do with they ate a little bit too much but that wasn't it. And so as they were walking and they felt their clothes was slightly too tight at some part of the body but that wasn't it. What it was was because their body was rubbing up against their clothes just a little bit more than it usually did. It stimulated a self image of the person being fat and the self image became oppressive all produced by being just slightly. And that was probably from childhood and all the rest of it. Maybe what's being said is it's never enough no matter what it is and we keep searching it's never enough. Okay. The approach taken in this practice and this is where I feel it becomes interesting. In other words I didn't bring the subject up just to make things worse than they already are or maybe but rather quite the contrary. This is our condition we all have these difficulties. And if you can understand that it could be something like your shirt collar rubbing up against your neck which as mine was just now and there's a slight itch which you don't want to be there. It's not enough to make a big thing out of but it was there for a split second or it could be food ending that you like it's delicious. And then suddenly it's gone. Or perhaps the Bell rings but just slightly too loud or maybe not loud enough or the retreat is ending too soon or not soon enough. Now what I'm suggesting is from the moment we wake up until we go to sleep this process is happening. Is it? Do you think that's an extravagant statement? Seriously this is not to make people convert to an ideology that life is Duker. It's more to point to exploration. Is it helpful for us to have this kind of a statement? The statement is putting on the agenda saying that this may be true in our life and then it's followed by the suggestion that we learn how to pay attention to it bring full awareness to it and that if we can do that perhaps there's some of the alchemy that Karato referred to the other evening that exactly those things which bother us become the ground out of which something else happens. Transformation. And so a large part of this retreat is learning how to do that. Often the questions are I had a good sitting or I had a bad sitting. More of that. And how do I get a good sitting? And how do I not have certain experiences that I'm having? How do I avoid them or make sure that they don't come back again? Or if they do come back again what do I do to get rid of them? And the teaching in many different ways is suggesting let it be observe it now. It isn't a kind of passive. It's not being simple minded. We're learning how to be simple but not simple minded. For example even with the hot Buddha cold Buddha if it were possible to let's say get air conditioning or for the room to be warmed you do that or if they're possible to have more clothes or less clothes or to get a cold drink to cool you down or to get a hot drink to heat you up. It's not saying to just grimly stay in any adverse conditions but what it is saying is that turns out to be your condition. That is if you're sitting here and you feel slightly too full from overeating or slightly this that or the other and you've decided to stay here or if there's no choice in many situations in life there's no choice. And so what is being suggested is to enter at that point with awareness that's when it's hot boot or cold Buddha it's not suggesting some kind of fatalism or futility to just give up and be destroyed by the forces it's to live intelligently. But very often there's a limit to what we can do or the thing is already happening. And the teaching is helping us learn what to do when it happens. And all it is is to let it be that is to meet it with great care and sensitivity and to learn from it. Because in many cases and try this the next time you find yourself suffering let's say around here ask yourself about it just for a moment just pause. And how did this happen? Why am I suffering right now? And very often I'm not saying all the time. Very often you can see how it was put together. Perhaps you had an expectation of a sitting you had a very serene sitting and then there's walking and then you can't wait to get back to the cushion and you sit down and the mind is all over the place and you suffer you find yourself being unhappy if you can at that moment see that the unhappiness has a great deal to do with the expectation that you had that the sitting should be a certain way. And then it turned out that it wasn't and that those conditions were necessary to produce the unhappiness in you. Whereas if we come to the cushion open not knowing really not knowing because perhaps we've learned that we don't have control we don't know literally what's going to happen from one moment to the next. Offer on the cushion when we sit down. If there's restlessness in the mind it's a lot different than if there's restlessness which had as a background the expectation that it was going to be peace or bliss there's a lawfulness going on. And as we start to pay attention as to how step number one is to be able to discern that we are unhappy which is a major step. Very often people are invested in not characterizing themselves as being unhappy. And so there's a lot of emotional resistance to this teaching because if we were to fully entertain the possibility of its truth it would point to looking at our lives which we might not like to do because of the pain and also perhaps because it would be very inconvenient it might suggest that we would have to change our lives a lot. And so very often the subject is skipped and what we do is gloss over it. We set up fanciful futures. The future is always fine because it hasn't happened yet whereas we can't possibly blow it because it hasn't happened. And so we live in the future a lot or we have romanticized memories of the good old days. So what is being suggested here is step number one is can you just pay attention to see that it's there? That's a giant step just to know that it's there and then the discerning mind is brought to it. All the things we're developing on the breath on walking all day long can you bring a gentle but decisive attention to where you find yourself? And sometimes in that looking there's also discovery of how you created that moment what had to happen for that moment to be what it was the ingredients the conditions the causes and conditions that had to collaborate for you to be unhappy in that moment. And even if it's over or if it's too late sometimes just a glimpse of that in retrospect just seeing how you put it together allows us the possibility of doing it less in the future or catching it as it comes up earlier on before it's taken root. Now some of the practice that we're doing like following the breath is designed to generate a certain amount of joy and peace. Has anyone tasted a little of that in the time that you've been here let's say from the browser or whatever? You can raise your hand if you have. Is your Samadhi that strong or is it just what? In other words let me make a suggestion. It's been very quiet and of course we've been encouraging that we don't talk much. We sit up here to encourage you to sit. It's nonverbal teaching a lot. So we try to make every sitting one or both of us is here at every sitting if you've noticed it's not accidental. That's the teaching whereas we're trying to show that we don't talk a lot and that protects the silence except when they're interviews and Dharma talks. But also what we're trying to learn is to not get attached when it's quiet time to be quiet. But when it's talk time to let go of let's say the quiet which I know we all cherish or at least sometimes we do to let go of it and enter into the next situation which is at this point talking and listening. So it provides us with a challenge of learning how to make our meditation practice more pliable more alive more flexible. If you get locked into I'm a Yogi and think that that's what it is that's a bit of a rigid way to use the practice and then it prevents us from using the situations that come up fully. And I understand to do that means you have to shift gears from perhaps settling in being very laid back at this moment in the room because we're doing a lot of things that contribute to that to let go of that any clinging that you might see and to bring energy of a more social kind together it can be learned. In other words the more we try to do it the more we can do that. And then when the talk is over to let go of that by the way that's a large part of what comes out of the teaching in regard to the suffering. We haven't really gotten into the cause tonight. I mainly just want to suggest that it's there that there is a lot of unsatisfactoryness and that the beginning point is to acknowledge it to look at it and to learn from it. And as you start to do that what you may learn is that it comes about through attachment through holding on so much as I see it of what we're trying to learn is non attachment. It's not detachment. Detachment at times has a connotation of sort of pulling away from life and just watching it all go by. Sort of a wall flower if that term is still used at parties watching everyone dance around and eat and you're just backed off watching it so you can't get hurt you're also not in it and not having much fun. Non attachment which is what is being suggested is to learn how to live fully in the moment. And if the moment provides us with stillness or with an enjoyable companion or a good meal great than to enjoy that. And when we don't have that to be able to do without it in order to learn to live that way in order to life of nonattachment meaning you can do the things of life that isn't what causes the suffering. It's the clinging that does. It's a practice in itself. And we have to begin right now learning how to do each thing at its right time and place wholeheartedly and see when it's time to let go of it. Perhaps this is another example of it a kind of microscopic everything is set here. First of all just be quiet lay back. And what I'm suggesting is can we come out of that a little bit? Can you meet me in terms of talk and answer? Okay it's an invitation. See if it's true in you and see if there's some learning that's possible. If it's possible simply by seeing the state that you're in to be free of it free enough of it to be able to be a little bit more outgoing and social. And then when the talk ends go right to the walking wholeheartedly and so forth all through the day. That's a lot of what we're suggesting keeping the mind attentive from the moment we wake up until we go to sleep learning how to do that. Okay. I think that I've covered as much as I'd like to regarding this and would be interested in hearing if there's anything on your mind questions or comments. I wanted to ask in regard to transcending suffering. Aren't there certain inevitable kinds of suffering which would still take place? For example someone who loves dies. So you're sad Reagan does something that you don't like so you get angry. You're not talking about transcending in that sense or are you? Okay that's a good question. And it's a complex one. I'm talking to where we are. Well even we are. It's possible to get into a state of concentration. There's no Reagan. I mean there's no nothing. There's just a good feeling. And then suddenly you come out of it and there's Reagan again. What I'm talking about more is let's say you do lose somebody that you care about. It's not saying don't be sad or don't mourn. In fact it's saying wholeheartedly mourn. If that's what's happening then fully mourn. And so that you go through it and then it's over and then you can be joyful again. The suffering would come in the holding let's say denying that the person has died or is not there. That kind of pain. This is not a Hollywood ending type teaching just suggesting that follow your breath and we all walk out of here just radiant. But even there you can see there is a moment of freedom or you have an attachment to a certain kind of getting having quotes a good sitting you come to the cushion the expectation is there. There's the beginnings of pain emotional pain. When the sitting starts to be kind of bumpy awareness sees that it falls away and there's a certain joy. Again what I'm talking about is within range for all of us. We don't have to wait for Anatara Samyak Sambodi total unequivocal enlightenment. That's not what I'm talking about. However in this I know from reports I don't know it from my own experience. Consciousness can become so vast. I know it to some degree that is relative to my own. Wherever my starting point is which is not to say that's beyond yours or I don't know where it is relative to yours but I know where it is relative to mine. When the mind becomes more vast when the space that we live in becomes more vast the disappointments of life the things that don't go our way the things that are taken away from us the things that are given to us that we don't want don't have quite the potency that they do when the mind is very small when the consciousness is shrunken. And an ancient image that I find very helpful perhaps will help you. And this is how two people can experience the same thing rather differently. Let's say you take this and we put a tablespoonful of salt and fill it up with water. Mix it up. If you would drink it it would be very salty. You probably wouldn't want to drink it if we took that same tablespoonful of salt. And let's say we had a big swimming pool and put it into the swimming pool you wouldn't taste the salt be fine. You could drink it. It's just pointing to it. Some of you have read the work of Maharaj a very great Yogi in a book called Im. That where he's asked questions like this. And he said don't you get hungry? He said sure hunger comes up on the horizon of my consciousness. But for you it's like everything it makes or breaks your day. Where to me it's just a little thing that's come up on the horizon. It's a signal it's time to eat. It doesn't have that driven quality compulsive quality. See we're not trying to legislate how to behave. At least I'm not. I'm not saying don't mourn or go through life with a big smile. All I'm saying is if suffering turns up then work with it and bring awareness to it. Maybe this will help. It's a personal example. Some years ago at a monastery in Korea a nun died who was an elderly nun very beloved there. And there was a funeral and the body was burned. And sitting next to me it was a very well known Korean Zen master. And he started sobbing. I felt the way you did. I was wondering I don't know how you felt but I was a little bit disturbed by that because I thought he was a great Zen master. So the next day I went to an interview and questioned him about that. I felt Aren't you beyond that? You're his end master. And I didn't quite ask it that directly but I was trying to get out if it was uncomfortable for me. Everyone does that. You're like everyone else someone dies you cry. So what am I practicing Zen for? And he just roared with laughter. He just thought that my understanding of his end was very stilted and asked me if I'd been reading a lot of American books about it which of course I had. What he said was that this woman was an old and dear friend. They had practiced Dharma together for a long time many years and he was going to miss her. And so she died and he mourned and he went through it. It was this whole heartedly unholy mourning. So it's not a kind of a simple minded way of living. It has subtly to it. How do you gradually let go of the morning. Well there's no recipe. It has to do with totally morning. If there's holding back then it isn't totally mourning so it's going to persist. And how do you know if you're doing that? Sensitivity. Your friends will tell you now sometimes your friends will rush you because they don't want to be made uncomfortable by your morning because we don't want to be around unhappy people or. Okay someone died. Fine. One day two days. Okay let's now be chipper again. But I think as in all these cases you're the ultimate knower. And so it would call for real care and sensitivity if there's really a full acceptance of the fact that the person has died. Now there may be blocks to that. And then one works with those blocks. One brings awareness to you can feel the mind denying. I'd like to say a few words tonight about free attention. This is the third stage in the meditation instructions. For those who started out Friday night seems like a long time ago. If we've been moving and some of you came Sunday many of you we've been leading up to this. Not that you have to do this for the remainder of the retreat or this is the quintessence of meditation although some feel it is probably my own bias is that it is. But to give you a taste of it and then for you to work as you see fit. Free attention is sometimes called choiceless awareness comprehensive attention all inclusive attention just sitting pure witnessing to go back over what we've been doing. So we have a context for what we'll develop tonight. If you recall we started off with the breath. We picked one thing out of all the possibilities in the universe just the breath. And whenever attention moved from the breath we would very gently come back to the breath. Is that familiar? If it isn't you're in big trouble. I'm in big trouble too. So we had one object and we kept coming back to it. And then we opened the field of attention up to allow for the possibility that attention would move from that object which as we know it does. And then what? Attention moves to itself becomes the object of meditation. So that if your mind leaves the breath and goes to some part of the body that is vivid painful that isn't a disruption as it was with the first set of instructions. That isn't a distraction. It's just the next meditation object. It's not inferior or superior to the breath. And if you're having a hard time with that getting lost in it you go back to the breath a little bit earlier. If not stay with it during the life of that next object as long as it's stronger than the breath till it leaves. In both of these we're learning some important things. Important qualities are being developed. One is just to be able to place our attention someplace and to keep it there also in keeping it there noticing what's happening. Watching carefully we've been able to place our attention on the breath or another object. And then we're also able to discern increasingly more refinement in the behavior of what's going on in where our attention is. The other thing that we're learning is the beginnings of the art of allowing of nondoing noninterfering. And that's a very profound and important one. One approach to Dharma that's central and that's what we'll be getting into in the next few moments. That meant in terms of the breath allowing the breath to go its own way. If you recall we're not trying to even out the breath or smooth it out make it longer or shorter less bumpy nothing. We just let the breath do all the work not control it. And perhaps from time to time you see that in spite of that we do control the breath. In fact as your practice deepens you start to see that what you thought was not controlling the breath was we're self conscious we're goaloriented. We want to become super duper meditators. And so we're helping the breath along even though it needs no help. But we're beginning to learn to just allow to just let the breath follow its own nature. It's a very important lesson. In order to do that it means we have to let go of perhaps a lifetime of calculation scheming engineering orchestration manipulation goal directiveness and words like that. In other words there's a controller something that is controlling something in order to get somewhere. And that controller of course has the name Me. I you could call it ego if you like or self cherishing. So we've been doing that for a few days. What haven't we been learning in doing that? As long as we have a fixed object which we start with and come back to like the breath and a set of rather explicit instructions it's pretty straightforward. It could be like laboratory instructions or to some degree putting together an erector set or equipment that you buy in a shop follow the breath mind wanders come back pretty straightforward but there's controlling going on because we have to remember that the breath is really important. We have to keep coming back to it. There are a lot of issues around that. And so the center a center known as me is kept strong in that approach. Now even that approach if you persistently go through it will cut through the center. I think what we're moving to is I feel more in the direction of letting go of the center of decentralizing the controlling faculty namely me which is the meditator. And the meditator is the biggest problem in meditation. If it weren't for the meditator there would be some meditation happening here. And it's hard to maybe impossible to avoid that step because we're all encouraged to be meditators. The chief one is right in back of me up there perfect posture. He never moves to my knowledge never does walking meditation doesn't go to eat doesn't even go to the bathroom 24 hours a day right there. And we're all in our small way trying to approximate that. It's a self consciousness which is no different than any other form of selfconsciousness that we've had in our attempts to improve ourselves to become its ambition. We could call it spiritual we could call it Dharmic. But there is still that selfcentered entity that is striving to get somewhere. And at the beginning it's quite strong and it's very as. You know if you're coming into interviews interested in signs that you're doing it right or you're doing it wrong or it's a good meditation or a bad meditation or what does this lead to anyway? And why am I here? So there's a lot of concern and calculation and need for encouragement and to be reminded or to be pointed out to in the first place why are we here? What do you get out of it? And so that dynamic is alive as long as you have a specific object to come back to. It's a home. And that's of course the power of it. That's the beauty of it. The breath is recurrent it's always going on and it's a very wonderful natural home. And what we're moving into next is to develop a homeless home which is another way of saying to be at home wherever we are. If the only way we can be at home is by paying attention to the breath that seems to be rather limiting in life running around following our breath all the time because there's a lot going on in life. And it would be nice if we could just be at home wherever we find ourselves or when we're thrown out of our home there we are home again. We can't be thrown out of a home because everything is home this homeless home. In the next stage of the meditation instructions I feel it becomes less techniquey. It still has a practice feel to it. And it's still particularly if you're hearing it for the first time or even for the hundredth time it may still sound like it's a technique and yet more and more as you do it and I've been doing it for years it becomes less and less of a technique and more of it's more artful or I don't know what it is. I don't have words for a dog. What we're going to be doing in a few moments is to let go of the breath and simply to sit with no agenda no particular object to attend to. So we've been whisper breath. Now some of you for a week and in a few moments I'm going to suggest it's all right just sit still and pay attention to what's happening. And the breath is no better or worse than anything else. It's just the breath. And what will we attend to then? Well I don't know. Whatever life provides in the next moment. Did anyone feel any anxiety at that? You mean I can't hold on to the breath? I've just been learning how to anyone feel a little nervousness with that? If you do that would be what you would pay attention to. That is the fact that my God there's no breath to hang on to. Where do I go? What do I look at? What do I listen to? Well you listen to that because that's what's happening. So it's an extension of what we've been learning but only now we're throwing away. In a sense we're throwing away the water wings or the training wheels on a two Wheeler bicycle which was the breath the kind of support something that we can stabilize our attention with and know it's recurrent. We can always come back to it. It's wonderful that we have it and we will be using it again a lot. It's not that we're through with it or we've outgrown it. It's just that I would like for us to get a taste of something else. And then each person at their own pace can attempt to use this approach. Why call it free attention? Because there are no rules. Your mind is free. The only rule is to pay attention to what's happening now in this moment stick to the present bring awareness which we've been developing. It's not different but now bring it to what is most vivid what's most distinct whatever is most compelling. And you don't have to figure that out. Whereas we'll be told that each moment tells you what it is. Now for that to happen. And here's where something different begins to accompany these instructions at least for some people. If it's not for you don't worry about it. It may or may not happen. It comes very close to certain attitude that is expressed in many religions. Having to do with surrender also having to do with faith. It can. Okay the instructions in a few moments will be simple enough. It will be to just sit and to pay attention to whatever is there. It will also be suggested that to help you get a feeling for it you not reach out for anything because what is it you would be reaching out? That means you have some opinion some view as something is more important than something else. So if anything is to be attended to let it make the first move. Let it tell you so. You've become like a photographic plate totally 100% receptive. No fear about there being a shortage of objects or experience or consciousness or don't worry about it. Let life tell you what to know because it will from moment to moment. So we're beginning to develop a kind of mind that is listening listening with your whole heart and your whole body. But not listening to anything in particular. Not listening for anything in particular. It's a kind of waiting but it's a waiting without waiting what are we waiting for? Nothing in particular. We're just waiting. We're just receiving. We're just right there. Now whenever anyone gives instructions about this nondoing or just sitting you can't help but color it. And I'll just give you a sense of that. I've gotten different versions of these instructions and I have my own and each one will probably influence your mind somewhat. But if we know that then perhaps it can become closer to just you letting go surrendering to each moment. I've gotten these instructions in one context one monastic context where an analogy was used and it was a couple of them. One was it's as if you're in a forest and there's somebody out to kill you. You don't know where this person is. They might be behind you to the right or left or they might be in front of you and you're making your way through the forest with total attention panoramic all inclusive attention because any sound might be a sign that that person is coming to kill you. So do you see it's not located on a particular object. It's not the breath or anything else. That mantra. It's just the tension. And it has no locus. There's no inside there's no outside. You're attending to yourself. There's no nothing. It's just attention. But if you notice it has a certain angle a certain attitude accompanying it. Somebody's out to kill you and it's danger and that's why you're attending. That has a certain consequence for the mind. In that same monastery the way in which we did this practice you would sit for only a half an hour and tremendously intense. It was said to us if you weren't ringing wet with sweat and it had nothing to do with the season at the end of that half hour you weren't really doing it. So that was somewhat different than what I'm suggesting. It's sort of danger and full attention to danger with every ounce of attentiveness you could have like a crisis like your life is at stake and you can only sustain that for a short period of time. That's one way another way similar. An image used is that you're in a duel and you're facing your enemy and you're totally attentive to your enemy. But you also hear all the sounds and you see the other people watching the duel. But if you move for a second you could get killed. Those are one kind. There's another approach which is a little softer a lot softer. And that's the faith model. And the instructions might be something like we're all Buddhas right now. Each one of us has Buddha nature. Each one of us right at this moment is as perfect as we'll ever be. Our original nature is here right in this hall. So just relax. Just sit and know that there's no place to go to. You're already enlightened. Each one of us is already enlightened. Now the mind doesn't know that. So the mind is going to behave as if feverishly trying to get this and get that and reassure itself and worry about if it's doing right and all the things that minds do. And you just sit and relax and hear this poor misguided mind that doesn't know that it's enlightened go nuts trying to get something that it doesn't need because you already have it. And so if you have deep faith whether it's in the Buddha or a particular teacher or you might just have it who knows where it comes from? You trust. You have faith and you sit there and it can be a lot more relaxed a lot less striving not trying to get anywhere. And sometimes it can be quite hilarious if you accept this frame of reference when you see it's really true. The mind is like a four year old just feverishly trying to make something of itself get somewhere and then worry about not doing it and pick itself up and start all over again. And you just sit in a state of total faith and relaxation watching all this unnecessary effort. It can be quite hilarious and can take you deep. Now if you have deep and natural faith that might be good. Many of us don't. The modern world is not at this point famous for authentic spiritual faith. And I'm not talking about certain kinds of fervor which if you press beneath them I don't think it's genuine faith but just desperation or fanaticism or some kind of a belief. That's not what's being suggested by this style of teaching. I feel closer to that myself than the first but life has both. What I like to suggest as an attitude is one of just knowing. If we had to put it into a question the question would be what is this? What is happening right now? More the mind of discovery but it's not thought. So you're sitting back and there's no agenda. We're not with the breath or trying to get back to the breath or trying to get anywhere. We're learning how to be where we already are. We're learning how to get from A to A. And the question what is this? Just for a moment hear it even say it to you what is this? It's very powerful if you ask it about anything. And I think it's powerful because we don't really know what anything is. Ultimately maybe you do. I don't. And when you look very carefully and really are honest what is anything? And I don't mean long verbal explanations. When you listen carefully to them they're not fulfilling. They're just a bunch of words. And sometimes that's called don't know or beginner's mind. What is this? Can sometimes strip away a lot of the encrustations of familiarity or the routinization. We've been doing things and been conditioned so many years over and over and over again. We have all kinds of things of colored a certain way and we don't see things in a fresh way. And sometimes just asking what you thought the breath happened. Let's say the breath comes in. It's no longer privilege remember if it just naturally captures your attention fine. In words would be what is a breath. Again it's not thinking. I have to speak to you in words but it's more real interest real interest in what's happening. So I'm not assuming faith. I'm not assuming that you believe that you're perfect or that you have Buddha nature because you may not. In fact the odds are you don't. Okay so we're kind of moving slowly starting around the periphery and getting to this core activity of just sitting still and doing nothing. No calculation no scheming no goals. Just learning an art of doing absolutely nothing with total passion total interest. Can we do it? Why don't we try it for a few moments? It'll be short just five or ten minutes. Simply because it is. There no other reason needed. As you begin to notice what's there you can also see that it leaves and becomes something else in consciousness. And so now the mind in order to carry out these instructions of just allowing whatever is there to happen with no particular direction no motive other than the attention becomes a kind of surrender perhaps surrendering any words that you might have about why you came here or why you sit. Surrender to what? To God to Buddha nature. Those are just words to life. Also words. But what is at hand that we can trust independent of our conviction and opinions is that at this moment each one of us exists. No question about it. We just exist each one of us right now and that existence continuously manifests itself. The energy keeps becoming something else from moment to moment. So we're surrendering simply the process to use words. The best I can do is the process of life itself of our own mind and body allowing it to tell its own story. Not necessarily in words. In fact more and more it will be less and less in words. And everything is welcome opening our heart to ourselves. No more secrets from ourselves. All these many packs that we've kept little compartments places where we've gotten hurt and we don't want to know about those places. So we keep a secret from ourself. A lot of energy tied up in those secrets wasted things that happened 30 40 50 60 years ago still festering still controlling us today tragic has nothing to do with the present. And yet it reinstates itself over and over again in allowing everything to turn up and be attended to with care and attention. In doing nothing in having no agenda we're providing the mind with an invitation. It's as if we just have given up trying to make ourselves over into some perfect being trying to control the breath get back to the breath trying to be attentive trying to be a good spiritual person. And out of exhaustion we just fall over and just sit here with straight posture of course and give up because the mind is uncovernable and just sit quietly with great interest and let the mind and the body do all the work. The less we do the more we come to know when we do something like this. Now with attention having no boundaries no inside or outside a sound perhaps a half mile away is as welcome as an inner thought or feeling. So the inside outside boundary starts to melt. It was made by thought in the first place. Me and you many of us on various spiritual paths are oriented towards universal love. How can we love universally if we don't love ourselves? How can we fully love ourselves if there are still areas that we reject that are not eligible to fully be? And so these instructions have no instructions give permission to the mind to begin to empty itself and we resist it. We tighten up and we become aware of that too. Everything is absorbed into the practice. In beginning to learn how to let go of control the center that we've worked so hard to create begins to lose its seeming solidity becomes decentralized because it doesn't make the decisions now as to what to attend to. It just allows life itself to decide is just attention. What is this wherever you are at this moment? What is this without words? Had a brief sample of something you can do more of during the week to come. And we can also talk about how advisable it is for you to do a lot of it or a little of it. It really depends on how settled your mind is. And if you feel an affinity you're drawn in this direction just another point about it so there's no misunderstanding. And then we can have some questions if there are any. Free attention sometimes called choiceless awareness. It'S. In two senses that it's choiceless one in that the attention is nonjudgmental. That is we're not choosing one thing over and above another thing. I like this. I want it. I don't like this. I'll push it away. And if we find ourselves making choices then we bring attention to that itself. And it's choiceless in the sense that there's no agenda. That is we're just sitting allowing whatever it wants to present itself to do. So. Now strictly speaking it isn't choiceless awareness and it isn't true free attention. How could it be where I'm telling you to do it and you're making a choice to try to be choiceless. But where are we going to start? I don't know. I haven't figured out any other way. Then we're close to the edge. But the real choicelessness or the real free attention is something that ripens and I don't know how long it will take. If you have that question on your mind that's coming from a place that's very different than the spirit of this meditation as you can imagine maybe tomorrow maybe ten years from now when the mind settles into itself and it becomes a way of life to just live with kind of the mind of discovery attentiveness. So we're approximating it. We're approximating a mind that is free a mind that is not concerned with choices at least during this sitting. And we're trying not to try which is a contradiction. And the first time that I ever had even a glimmer of what this was about was during a sitting at a retreat much like this somewhere else. And the Bell rung. So the official sitting was over. The instructions were similar to what we were doing. Of course. I was trying to do it trying not to try or trying to just be choiceless. And I was getting a headache from so much not trying. And then as soon as the Bell rang of course the official sitting meditation was over. And so I didn't have to pay attention. And suddenly it started to happen just letting it all be exactly what it was. Okay. Any questions or comments and we'll have more opportunity to go into it as you gain more experience with this form if you're inclined to. I'm particularly interested in if you understand the instructions or the guidelines or any reactions or comments please.", 'human_start_time': '0:24:02'}, {'talkname': '19850711-Larry_Rosenberg-UNK-hot_buddha_cold_buddha-1526', 'question_num': 'Question 4', 'url': '/talks/1526/19850711-Larry_Rosenberg-UNK-hot_buddha_cold_buddha-1526.mp3', 'display_name': 'Hot Buddha/Cold Buddha', 'date': '7/11/85 0:00', 'start_time': 5257390, 'content': "I feel very comfortable with.

Live out your entire boring life problem. Were you trying to do that or is that what happened? I understand of course. Okay now let's start the movie a little earlier in the lobby. And what it includes is your anticipation about what's going to happen. There's wisdom in that. There's something we learned from that. It didn't happen didn't it? How often do we go through that one? But if we could back off again there's some fine print on the contract here which I forgot to mention. It's not a way of escaping from having difficulty paying attention to the breath. Other words. See sometimes people say oh I love this this is great. Why didn't we start with this? And it has a little bit of sort of someone let out of school at 03:00. I've been trying to be with the breath. Go away from the breath come back go away from the breath come back. And now he says just great wherever you are is okay. We can just play and go swimming and go to the playground. And this is what I call meditation. But then there's a test and the test is how alert and sensitive in order how discerning is there real attention in this freedom? And by and large everyone I've known has had to really work with both. Whereas it would be good if being able to attend to the breath becomes something that it's not a problem for you and probably at that point this will naturally be available to you. But I'm not saying don't do it because you can also develop your attention Especially if you're attracted to it on this. Some people and I've seen this happen too. It's not so often but it does happen are so drawn to this. Their natures are so drawn to just having the freedom to explore whatever is there that they become very concentrated this way and they develop the same things that are needed to be developed on the breath at which point they can go back to the breath and they find that it's not so difficult after all. So it's very much an individual thing. And we'll work through that in interviews and group discussions. Anyone else? Sure.

However you come to it whether it's through years of sitting or what I saw in the oriented. Some people grow up in a very pious Buddhist family and not just the outer crust. I mean genuine and their faith is beyond what I have. You know it's very difficult for a Western to find that faith anymore. I know it still exists in the west and it has existed in much greater intensity and was more abundant in the past. But right now it's not so relevant and prevalent. It's the scientific age and so much has been undercut. Now here I don't mean faith as a belief but a deep trust. And if you have that fine. That's a tremendous advantage for you.

What I'm concerned about is really being open and mindful I guess about how to stay open and be safe. Yeah. And safe. Okay. We're not learning how to be stupid and set ourselves up. And it was just a dangerous neighborhood. Whoares. Can tell you that. Maybe you walk around it. See I'm not suggesting that you do that. That's your intelligence. It's for you to decide that. I don't really know the answer to that. Each situation will call out a certain response. It doesn't mean that you have to go through a combat zone. Yeah. I don't even know. Okay. You're walking down the street and you know how some of these police cars go by the sirens? The sound is worse than the crime that they're going to prevent. And you hear it. And immediately we set up resistance. It's kind of an opposition and it's tiring. And then we say some uncomplimentary words about the police and something like that. Instead the next time just surrender open to it just as we've been learning here and get a free hit of energy and say you know it's great. The police are giving you all this incredible energy. Just let it in. Don't resist it. Experience your negativity towards it and it's the same. A bad situation is a good situation. The main principles are in the teaching. What I'm saying is not new. And all it is is a matter of applying it perhaps in situations that are not talked about in most of the books that we read because perhaps most of the teachers were living in monastic or different situation. And so the principles I have found to be sound. But now I feel our generation has a challenge of working them out in the midst of city life relationship et cetera. It's not going to be handed to us. We have to find out how to bring this practice into those situations. But I feel the principle is a sound whereas you would notice fear if that's what you're experiencing and you take it from there. Sorry probably whatever question you ask now it'll all be the same answer. I'll try to say it in different ways. Pay attention with sensitivity to our life as we actually live it not as we think we live it or as we think we should live it but our actual life from moment to moment. How do we actually live? And you won't find out unless you pay attention. You'll be living in some conclusion that's probably erroneous and selfserving. Now if you have other friends. And of course this is something I forgot to mention. Group sitting together. Even if you can't come to IMS so often even if it's just one other friend to just sit together maybe just once a week or inquire and find out if there are groups around where you live. That's very helpful. Surely you must see that from just this weekend so that we have support particularly in terms of frightening things or unpleasant things. Any other questions you'd like for what. That answer is in terms of understanding? Let's say the situation is not a police vehicle. It might be a fire sight louder. Are you saying that opening to that noise in fact is a way of protecting yourself? And that one would not be. I'm thinking of the decimal. Yes. So what I'm trying to understand. Are you suggesting that relaxing and opening to that is a way of also protecting yourself? Good. You see that it's not a formula or a recipe or cookbook that is. There's an objective reality. And if the sound is so deaf and loud awareness might tell you to walk away from it and go around a different street or close your ears. Absolutely. Or what you might do is but if you've made the choice to stay there. And sometimes that's what I'm saying. If you are there and there's no escape from it then learn how to move with it. How to notice the contraction in the body how to notice mental resistance to it and allow it in. I don't know if I'd call that protection because then it still has a little bit of the boundary going. It's more that's what's there. That's what is. That's what's happening. And it turns out to be easier if we move with it than if we fight it. And so at any moment intelligence is part of awareness. Definitely leaving the situation covering your ears could be a perfect action. Any other questions you've to ask the big question? I guess it does but not necessarily. Perhaps what you think of as your body living forever from a certain deep point of view. And that has to be tested by each one of us. You were never really born. Believe you. For this one to take back home you were never really born. So how could you possibly die? And so of course we all are eternal. The illusion is that we think we are these finite entities that are coming and going and living and dying. And so from the point of view of absolute truth nothing has happened. So nothing to worry about. You're all set for life. But practically speaking you better take very good care of this life or you'll never even get in the running of finding out of what I'm saying has any possible truth at all. Reflect on things like timelessness or Infinity or an image we use in one of the discussion groups of the ocean and waves that as you focus on waves it looks like everything is changing and coming and going and dying being born and dying. But if you look at the ocean nothing has happened. Same water just taking on different forms waving itself and the waves are real too. And the ocean is real too. Well maybe that's a Hollywood ending for us. Happy ending. Okay.

Yes. I just assume we can talk about it. Yes. No question about it. Perhaps one quick question. Sure. I don't know if this is a quick question but is the point of the practice to make the moment always present or to let go of it so the moment is never present? Well a lot of people nowadays it's become very fashionable. Where I live in Cambridge everyone's letting go of everything except I think what they're really saying is they're throwing away and pushing away. I think a lot of times what we're talking about when we say letting go it's really letting be. If we allow something to come up and we meet it with full attention in that moment it runs its course. It runs its natural course and it's probably less likely to come back or whatever happens. It runs its course. No what we're attempting to do is to be with what's happening as it's happening. And many consequences flow from that one of which you see if you're fully attentive totally and especially as attention becomes stronger you can't be both attached and attentive at the same time. The attachment cuts identification. Does that mean anything to you? The awareness itself is a very powerful energy especially as it starts to develop. If you're very identified you're not going to be very aware of what's happening in the moment because you're caught up in the identification. There are some approaches that talk about disidentification. I feel that what we're doing. We're not trying to disidentify. It's just that by seeing the identification it loses its potency and you're just present with it. Does that make any sense? Yeah it doesn't sound it. You have to convince me. Now if there's something unresolved please continue. I was just thinking there's four logical precept something that is something that isn't something that is and isn't a Tesla anyway. You're saying that it is and isn't at the same time the moment. At the risk of sounding snide I would suggest you go back to your breath. Okay. I'm not saying that logical scheme doesn't have its value. Value. But what I'm saying is really quite simple. Or for example right now just pinch yourself. Please do it. Really pinch yourself. Can you feel that now? Make it harder? Can you feel that it's harder? That's it you just did it only we're doing it for more than just that kind of a simple experience. We're doing it with everything. And that's why you can talk about what's happening is we're becoming more intimate with life with our own mind our own body. And then as the mind becomes clear with nature with everything around us we're more in direct contact with what's happening now. There's only now does that help? There is only now there's no other place to be whoop we already left. Whereas we may even having a memory is happening now and having a future projection is happening now. And all that's being suggested is very simple turning towards what is happening now with concentration and sensitivity. Okay why don't we do some walking one thought I had is there a number of you who are really new and you're going through things that are different? In my opinion based on the number of you that have come up here a growing number what I thought might be helpful is a small meeting of those who are here for just the first time in the library right now because I think the kinds of questions that you have are unique for you. So if you would like to come I'll go to the library during this walking period and it's only for those people who just arrived who've never been here before. You don't have to come.

I never know whether it's now or not. You tell me. I don't know how Paris is. Maybe it's medium rare. But I don't know. Well but you knew enough to say what you just said. So maybe that's what's happening. It isn't quite there. What does that mean? It's your mind. I don't know what it is. It's not that different from what I have often times experienced before. And what it seems to me to be is the stuff I which forms are made. Sounds good to me. I think there are depths of it and we have a lot of conditioning and no doubt that's with us a good deal of the time. Do you feel that is? I know it's a firm so I cannot take that away. The fact that I know it's a firm but when I see a shadow on my foot making a color in there with my toes and I love that I still know what it is. But that's very nice because nothing I've seen before. Okay. There's a Fern and you're looking at it and it's not a Fern but we've made it into a Fern. It's just a word. And Fern probably has a lot of associations. Supposing you're a botanist then you'd be in real trouble. And especially the shadow is interesting. And I put my foot on it there and it looks like the most beautiful formation on my foot. I can't believe how nice this furnishing. He underfolks herself. Then I see all those things and I enjoy them and I don't stop thinking. I tell myself everything I see while I'm seeing it. And I think this is not really fair. That's right. Okay so let's work through this. We come upon almost like frames of a movie. We come upon something in nature. And oh there's a Fern and everything that you've said comes out about it. If there's real attention to the Fern that breaks the momentum of the past. Now some of it is simply hearing your mind producing all this verbalization whereas we're not trying to forcefully subdue a lifetime of experience. But what we can do is we bring a steadiness to the Fern and we hear the mind producing all this stuff about it. Now in the hearing of the stuff that's produced about it it starts to fall away. And if we can stay with the Fern at some point it will become just what it is even for a few seconds. And then maybe thought reintroduces itself and it keeps going like that where it's just you've seen it for the first time. It's Ellery Street for the first time. And then thought reestablished itself again. And there's old Ellery Street again. What a drag. So it requires their attention in two senses one to the physical form which we call Fern and then their attention to thought as thought. First I want to say that. But first it is a plan. Yeah that's right. And then I found out that some of the leads are not leaves but shadows of other leads and they are darker. And that's terribly interesting that's you're too intelligent. At the same time. I have the sun on the skin and everywhere. And the words you see are not primary. The words are sent in there but they're still there. And actually I do confess I do at the end also enjoy it more. If I can give birth to what I just said. It's not a sin. Don't worry. No. Their attention to the words would be that's okay. We're not trying to choke that off. Well are you saying that it's not possible to have a direct perception of the firm? Yes. Okay. But you're doing the exercise fine. Exactly. Well time will tell you keep doing it. But see there are two you've done the exercise correctly in that you're noticing the Fern. And then if you understand the thinking as thinking then the bare attention you're intimate with the Fern and you're intimate with language with the production of language. Let's go to another realm for a moment. The body in a way there are two bodies. There's the body body and there's the mind body and the body body is this and the sensations. But then we have all these images thoughts and you have a lot of expert knowledge about a body. So then there would be a whole nother body which is really the mind images about the body knowledge of the body. And so if we were trying to let's say directly perceive the body we would have to become sensitive to the mind body and be able to distinguish the two. So it's something like that. Don't make it laborious or dreary or it's lighter. I think you have the right spirit. Now you might want to inquire as to why it's necessary to have language as the final cap off. I'm doing that. The only thing I wanted to add is that I sometimes in order to try to be true to users the service I recommend and that I look at other things which I'm not worth to begin with. Like the way the roofs cross over on that forest path out there they make the most certain. And also when I walk the road down to the Lake the way the cement on the road is correct. So these things are things I'm screening myself on. They're easier aren't they? They're easier. Why? Yeah why? You don't have as much knowledge and verbal. Sophistication about that stuff. I'm just trying to find out. No but I think this would really be I think the most become something again with its nervous. But still these Azure pictures pictures which are totally confusing because they are too green meaning depending on how you look at them they are very vaccine. You know those pictures is a master of everything in that regard from done think of nothing. So that I think is the most perfect example of direct perception. Because it has to be direct. They cannot be perceived any other day other than the rank. Unless you trick. Okay. I guess some of what was implied earlier is that the degree to which we live in almost an ocean of symbols now between the proliferation of knowledge and cinema and TV et cetera we're not living in it. We're living in an abstract world cut off from direct contact with Ferns and roots and whatever else people. And the practice is so very simple that it's an attempt to become direct again. Live in a real world which has breath and which walks tastes food feels its own suffering feels its own joy. Instead of the enormous sophistication conceptual sophistication which has atrophied our ability to experience life directly. Our bodies. We're not in touch with our bodies so much. We know everything about the body except the body. There was some restlessness. It's not the public school again. You're being chatted for being restless. It's just that when you're restless are you attuned to it? Are you noticing it? What I'm suggesting is we maintain the same intensity. We keep remaining alert to what's going on. Now you may be interested in hearing certain things and bored with other things. And why doesn't he shut up? Or whatever it is that isn't as important as you are staying alert and moving with it. Staying in direct contact with it. What? Okay. And so then what happens to you when you can't see? Okay so you're getting restless that your visual stuff is not so clear. Look at that. You have a great Bodhisattva. Is he one of those arms? No I don't care. I'm restless too. It's not an accusation. You think it was an accusation. There were a number of hands out of whoever.

The way I was seeing things was I was standing still and everything else was bouncing around the room up and down walking and turning and looking. It was like the room was turning. And in the spare attention period I also have a shift of perception with in antibiotics my book on Craftsman Road. And I'm.

Looking at my eyes to improve my vision and it is a way of seeing where you let go of the concept of how you're seeing. It's an exercise. I don't know if it's a dream. Take you really were seen without preconception because if you look without preconception turn your head and really look you'll start to see things move as if you were a movie camera and you're seeing without the concept of how we achieve that. As you go this way this stuff moves here and then as you turn your head it moves this way there's. A different way of seeing instead of. Seeing everything stationary things start to move because if you drive and wrong you start to see.

Now we actually are doing this practice even if you never heard this wonderful brilliant talk. Just kidding. Some of you are a little serious tonight. What is it? Long day or what? Okay where were we? Help me out. Someone. Yes we were. All right. I got it. For example you've done some of this practice right? So let's say you're instructed to pay attention to the body and you feel bodily sensations and somebody insults you and says you think you're wonderful but you're just as far as I'm concerned you're a jerk and you're fired. And suddenly you feel that hurt. Now you can look because it registers in the body. And often it's taught some teachers teach it an Indian teacher named Gorenka that's his whole teaching is to look at bodily sensations because the body does express some of what's going on in the mind. It has to. The two are interconnected. And if you just look at that in that moment if you're really attentive there's no me or mine. But that requires full undivided attention. And it's not strained. It's not like it's because as you practice this the quality of awareness becomes more natural and more available to you. And you're aware of the ache and the pain and where you feel it in the body. And when you're really totally there there is no me or mine. So in that sense. But now if your attention wavers even for a second suddenly the mind comes in and starts telling you about what that person said. And then you start imagining if you lost your job you're imagining what life is going to be like. And suddenly you have torment. But I'm going to push it back one step further. Is it possible that when somebody insults you you don't even get hurt in the first place? And I would say it is. Now can we start right there? Not too likely because if you are fully present and let's say you say to me this is the worst Dharma talk I ever heard in my life you are an idiot. I'm never coming back here again because I'm fully enlightened. I just hear it because there's no one there. In other words that's why I'm fully present because Larry ain't here. It's a great world when I'm not here and I don't know you but when you're not there you're more alive because who you think you are is who you think you are. It's an idea. It's a construction. So rather than me tell you what's right find out for yourself. But you'll see at very least you can't help but see that the mind plays a huge role in either enhancing eliminating or making a byproduct of the awareness can be the suffering just falls away or if there's not much awareness and for most of us to be you know if there's very little then there's a huge amount of suffering. When you look carefully you'll see the mind is playing an extraordinarily important part in that because your question is a very good one because what is being said is this sense of me and mine is created by the mind. It's not there the way a tree is although it appears to be that solid. May I ask the follow up? Of course. In terms of practice eliminate. See if you can use another language because then you have a war. I gave an example. First off again it's the follow up question. I'm going to take the time to try to answer it in a little bit of detail because it's for all of us when you're fully paying attention to what's happening. And this is something you have to see if it's true maybe I'm deluded. When you're fully paying attention there is no self consciousness there. And you'll see that that is very different now to begin with you're trying to do it. So there is self consciousness. You're trying to learn how to do it. As the practice becomes more mature naturally it becomes effortless. As more and more. There's not one answer to your question. For example if learning how to live is central to wisdom then maybe the most important kind of learning that can go on is seeing the enormous price that we pay from living an egocentric life. And that again is not an ideology. It's that you see it. In fact you see that living in a certain way produces suffering. It is the source of suffering. There's some security but finally there's a huge price being paid for being preoccupied with yourself. So then the mind might say well then I'll become a Saint but that could be the ego again now becoming a Saint. So the reason I'm not using the term like how to get rid of it because then that's a struggle is just to see it. Now when you start to tap the depths that's in you it's in all of us. The constructions of the mind take on a new meaning to you. They'll seem relatively trivial. As you can really see the mind is blabbing on about who you are. Now do you see what I'm getting at? Because you're situated in a much deeper place than the ideas and images that are strongly conditioned from a lifetime of being told who you are starting when you're a little girl people looking at you and you being interested. First you're given a name and then it goes from there and then school and friends. And before we know it we have a whole scrapbook and life is not necessary. This is saying that enhancing the story or getting better pictures in the scrapbook is not what Dharma is. Dharma is going to opening up another dimension that's much deeper. In my experience the deepest healing comes in the silence not in trying to heal anything. And more and more you live from the silence. And it's not limited to special times and places. You can be in Times Square New Year's Eve and inside be at peace or it's inner peace. How do you get to inner peace at least with this practice by seeing the lack of it? We're not at peace. If you were you wouldn't be here. And there are plenty of people who are not here who are also not at peace. It doesn't mean that people who are not here. So as you start to see the many ways in which selfing let's just call it selfing here's one thing you will see if you watch it things come and go and go. There's nothing that you can point to and say this is me because it just lasts for a while and then it's gone and then something else comes. Maybe there's a pause and then maybe there's no construction telling you who you are and it's a relief. You feel at peace for two minutes. And then suddenly the machine starts in again. And it could be contradictory with what Jessica preceded. It said first you're wonderful and then the next one says who are you kidding? And you watch. You see that all of them are constructs. Their ideas they're mental notions. And as you watch them arise and pass away they start losing their power. Then you start to taste a mind free of notions about who it is and it's just superior. So there's an intelligence in us which prefers to live there rather than to try to get the perfect me endlessly and get the world to tell us how good we are and then get so hurt when it doesn't making any sense to start anyway. Please. Seems that a lot of systems we make in life are kind of predicated on what is the conception of medium. Exactly. And I'm wondering how we start to make decisions. It's not that you don't let it touch you. It doesn't touch you. First of all to begin with the old mind is making the decisions. That's the same mind that got us into the predicament that it's trying to get us out of. In other words it's the past the mind everything knowledge being what we've learned which has its obvious use but also experience what's happened to you in your life. That's all in your computer and we're seeing the world. That's what I mean. The mirror is not clear. You're seeing what's right here through yesterday's eyes. It's unavoidable. We all begin that way. We don't know it which means that we're motivated. We have likes and dislikes and prejudices and fears and apprehension etc. Interpretations. None of that is clear. Seeing. With practice the seeing starts to become clearer. Now let's say I have a reaction to something you just said. And then let's say decision in the sense of what I say to you will be a reaction. And it comes from my past. Where else is it going to come from? I'm made up of the past. When we take the power out of that by being aware of it and it gets weaker there's something much deeper. And from that place I would call that a response not a reaction. Now the mysterious part to this day for me because I've been at this for a while is that that clear mind which is not from the past. It's a form of intelligence that has nothing to do with your conditioning or your culture or what's happened to you can draw upon let's say technical knowledge if you're a scholar or you're this or that. And also you don't have amnesia so it can make use of the accumulations but it realizes what they are their accumulations. And more and more you're rooted in who you always were which is not an idea. And so the decisions. Now this is something you really have to test. I can just tell you from my point of view because I've seen it over and over again not only myself but others. This by the way is within reach of all of us. It's not just unique people but you have to have interest in it. I far more trust action that comes out of a clear mind which means a mind that isn't ruled by the past that has a much greater likelihood of being wiser and kinder than the old mind which is just the old patterns constantly reasserting themselves again and again slightly new combinations. Now how do you know if that's true or not? You're going to have to take the practice into the fire of living and see if it's true. But if you're new probably some of what you need to do is work with the mind to get it to be calm and clear enough so that it's fit to be able to look at the things that come up which are very challenging fear loneliness etc. Etc. Do the words at least make a little bit of sense? What is the relationship between egoistic and action or inaction? That's just what I go ahead. The sort of sense that means nothing happens. You don't strive for anything. How to kind of shape action in the framework of being ego. But this is what they say in all the talk shows. In all due respect you're interpreting something that's your conclusion about what the empty mind is. And it's typical. We think of it as fatalistic and passive. How can anything get done? It's just going to sit here like that. The Buddha got a lot done. Jesus got a lot done. Action doesn't have to come from ambition from striving from conflict from friction. It can come from love. And so the clear mind part of the challenge is it has to be brought into life. I've been saying that again and again. You've heard that. I know. And what I'm saying is that that improves the quality of your action because it's coming from a place that's deeper than the same old conditioning. And some people the temperament would vary. Some people would be more let's say reclusive scholarly introverted. Some people be more extroverted. The clarity must express itself through your particular character structure your equipment for example. Let's say you and I I don't know you but you and I tap this silence and then the next challenge is to learn how to soak in it to let it work on you. It may sound like it's just a holiday. Something extraordinary goes on in the silence. Now how I express the silence has to be through the only equipment I have which is how I've been shaped. So it will be expressed through someone like me. May I ask what your work is or anything about your interest? Software engineer. Okay you're a software engineer. I am definitely not a software engineer. I'm a dinosaur. Okay? That pure energy. That pure intelligence. I would go so far in my case if you put me in front of said do something. I can't. But in your case the clarity can be expressed through technical knowledge. It's not like you throw away what you've learned. And that's where tea ceremony martial arts. Some of that is romanticized in my opinion but that means you express yourself in the world from a place that is a different quality of energy. And everything that you've learned can be used by even thought. But now without examining thought we're used by thought. Now that's another conclusion that you have to test. We're learning how to use thought when it's appropriate and how to let it go and just be silent. So someone might be very active and someone else might just sit in the mountains for their whole life. And so that has nothing to do with the clear mind. That is how you express it now in the work with my own teachers let's say when the sitting got very strong they then started challenging me. Okay take that into your you're going to visit your parents this weekend bring it to Brooklyn. That's the ultimate challenge at least for a guy like me. What he was doing first of all he didn't say that for a while. Then at a certain point if the mind is a little bit more clear test it and see people who look at you who love you but they don't understand what you're talking about. They disapprove of what you use that you drop what you used to do and you've picked this up instead. And then if they get to you then you see that there's more to go. You're still fragile. The mind is still fragile. It doesn't fully have confidence in itself. So it isn't a teaching of fatalism and passivity. Let me give you an example because one of the teachers who's influenced us a lot here is Ajian Cha. My own training. Most of the pasta I learned was in Thailand in the forest tradition. And a lot of what we're talking about is equanimity in order for the mind to be really economist to be able to handle whatever comes at it in an even way. So in the forest tradition the way it works is each meditator has a separate little hut. It's not a forest it's a jungle. Okay so you're in your hut and you can't see anyone else's hut. There's a set of pathways that interconnect everyone. They all lead to a central clearing area where there's a big hall where the community meets together for meals or maybe a talk by the teacher and be like this hall but for the most part you're in your own hut and you can't see anyone else's hut. So there was a tremendous rainstorm a tremendous wind and rain and it went on for days. And after it was over this teacher Ajun Cha some of you have heard us mention him and his books are in our library. He went around to check to see how all the yogis were in their individual huts. And he came to one and one part of the hut was completely blown away. It's thatched roof and the meditator was sitting under it. Soaked. That part of the hut was soaked. And he was sitting there with a kind of proud look on his face. And so the teacher asked me what's going on? He said well my equanimity was just no problem. And he says yes but that's the equanimity of a water Buffalo not a person. Let me bring it closer to home. Let's say hopefully this doesn't happen. Let's say we're all sitting with our eyes closed. This question is very rich. Sorry. We're all sitting with our eyes closed. And suddenly it starts getting very hot and then really hot. And then sweat starts pouring down. And since I do peak you're not allowed to peak. But I have to see how it's going. I peak and I see the center is on fire. It's not like you sit here. Temperature going up right. Armor blaze left part of the room. The person who's clear it should be the first one to get everyone to get out of here. Okay. Now here's the opposite of that which would be a caricature which is what you're getting at. This actually happened many many years ago. John cabotzin who some of you have worked with and I used to teach together at the Cambridge old Baptist Church. And I would teach the meditation part And John would teach the yoga part. And then at any rate and there was a stage where people would put their belongings and then we'd sit. And the teachings that I would give is sort of like just let everything happen. Just sit just be yourself. Allow whatever's coming and going. It's a typical I don't know if you've heard it but it's no agenda. And one day and people are sitting with their eyes closed and whatever is there that's what your life is in that moment. Just fully be with it and watch it. And then you see it go and then whatever is next. And so it was all this kind of relaxed open up to let everything happen. And someone came in while we were doing that and made off with a lot of wallets and computers and everything. Name it's.", 'human_start_time': '0:58:01'}, {'talkname': '19870523-Larry_Rosenberg-UNK-naturalistic_observation-1538', 'question_num': 'Question 1', 'url': '/talks/1538/19870523-Larry_Rosenberg-UNK-naturalistic_observation-1538.mp3', 'display_name': 'Naturalistic Observation', 'date': '5/23/87 0:00', 'start_time': 2719010, 'content': "Right. Me too. One of the things that. For our feelings this is or is you have to really feel your feelings to do this properly. See letting go is not pushing away. Letting go often is synonymous with letting be to fully let a feeling be a feeling and to run its course and then you've let go of it. That's one of the main uses of it from that point of view. It's emphasized in the Pastana practice. One very important part of the practice is knowing feelings as feelings. Knowing a feeling is a feeling. But part of the training is definitely to not get caught in the feeling to not identify with the feeling whereas I am jealous. This is my jealousy. Now maybe it's that part that you're not comfortable with. Does that make any sense? Sometimes it does. Okay I'll wait till it does and then you can. The art of doing what I've just suggested is not something that comes overnight. It's a lifetime effort. Lifetime's effort. It's not a three month course effort or a weekend. I think for most of us perhaps all of us it's an ongoing way of learning about what attachment is learning about what letting go is and more and more being attracted to traveling light. Again the traveling light is not the number of objects but how we relate to the objects. It's not saying don't have feelings. It's how we relate to the feelings. It's not saying to not be loving or even to have. It's not saying just have a loincloth and give away your home and your bank account. You can be just as unfree with no possessions. You can get attached to not having any possessions. It can be very fierce. There are a number of very famous Zen Coons which deal with that where the person thinks well yes I've dropped everything. And then the teacher will say Drop that too. I said well what do you mean I have dropped? Well if you insist then carry it around. So it's not easy to learn how to do. Our natural bent is to grasp onto and to push away and to take it as being eye and mine. I'll tell you if you cycle into the agreeing part let me know. I could use a little right now. I've had a lot of difficulty over the years feeling anger and I just. Started to feel it especially after you heard this talk. I have difficulty knowing how much when to try and let it go how to look at it. Should I bring you to me? Yeah. It's not that you shouldn't feel it because that would be trying to impose something on it. It's really seeing it now to begin with you might take on it's a teaching and that's often how teachings work. First it's theoretical and provisional and then little by little we make it our own as we really see. If it is a good teaching for us we really see that it's true. Anger is a difficult one because Buddhists are really down on anger. There's just not much room for anger. And the New Age just loves having all kinds of techniques and therapies to get anger out again personally what I've found is I've been forced for myself and for people I work with to be pragmatic about it. And there are sometimes people have so much anger or it's been kept on repressed for so long or it is repressed that it's necessary for certain kinds of expressive therapies to use them. And then at a certain point you can bring a more contemplative approach into play. But clearly one thing that probably does make sense whether you're Buddhist or not Buddhist is if you're directing the anger a lot you're going to cause a lot of suffering for yourself and others. Now the teaching itself whether you have a hard time doing it or not is neither repressing the anger nor getting lost in it. It's sort of slipping in between those extremes. It's very delicate like a brain operation sometimes just going right in there and fully feeling the anger but not smashing someone over the head or pressing it down or pretending that it's not there. So it takes training. Now that's what our training is. We're learning that on at the beginning one of the beauties of the breath is that it's not so problematic every now and then it is for someone. Perhaps you have asthma or something but for most of us it's a rather neutral pleasant event as the breathing goes. So we're learning how to be with things and we're learning how to be with unpleasantness. And at the beginning most people can't really observe anger and fear too well. We get lost in it or sadness a lot of strong States like that. But as I say as the practice gets matures more and more we're able to observe it in a naturalistic way. There's anger is part of the universe. There's no question about it. It's a real energy and it's as real as a thunderstorm or an earthquake. So even here that kind of an attitude might help you work with it. Somebody's hurt you a lot you're angry. It's natural. Yes it would be nice. But unfortunately when we get angry we usually don't have the kind of judgment well again I would say probably what is most important is how conscious you are when you're doing it. I think it is possible. I know it's possible that more and more and this is not unique to the pasta. Many people who have been in therapy obviously have improved their ability to do this. The more you are genuinely in touch with your anger that are taking responsibility for it. You fully experience how angry you are and you learn how to do that. You're more able to talk to the person who perhaps is involved in it to let them know without dashing them first either verbally or otherwise. It's a difficult one to work with and there's no one solution. There are particular contemplations that can help like meta or sometimes reflecting. I personally have found reflections very helpful reflecting on the futility of let's say violence and aggression. What do you really accomplish? Maybe a momentary catharsis. Usually what's left is just horrible what you've done to other people. And then they have to get back at you. And it goes on and on. It's called the world. Time for one more please. Yeah go ahead. It's all right. Well you've known me a long time. You've seen me go through a lot of stuff and I've dealt with a tremendous amount of fear and rage that I pushed away inside myself for a long long time. And in the last few years I've been getting much more in touch with this. And a couple of things that came up to my mind when I heard you talking. One is that it's amazing how when a person just starts to allow these emotions that we've been pushing away all our lives to be there it gets easier and easier to deal with them to be with them. I mean I pushed them away for so long that it was like a volcano when they came out. And I felt totally in chaos for a few years while things leveled out. But being courageous in the beginning and just owning them and letting them be there was the first really big step. And then after a while now it's just flesh me out. During that phase you weren't doing much of a pasta right. During the volcanic phase. Right. What I'm getting at where other therapeutic modes more helpful at that time? Yes because I was so terrified. I was so terrified at the power of my rage and also at the intensity of my fear that I just felt like I was drowning in both of those feelings and that I needed help from people to get to dare to go through it. But there was something oh this may sound a little contradictory but in dealing with my rage what I've found is that when I'm being and it's been really working for me to learn how to express anger in a way that's not venting it at someone I've found that if I can express my anger with kindness which means that I'm being kind to myself and also to the other person like there's something that expressing it is really going to be contributing something positive then I allow myself to express it. And if I feel like where it's really coming from is just wanting to wound the other person then I don't let it out and I deal with it. And I found that to be really helpful. It takes a lot of discipline. Has the pasta helped? You. Know I'm just not creating really angry situations. Is this practice helping you now? Can you spell that out? Because that might help people regarding anger. Don't worry about time. We'll just walk a little less. It's all. Well a way that's tremendously helping me is just helping me even know what my feelings are. I think one of my big difficulties for a long time was that strong feelings would come up and I wasn't even able to identify. This is anger this is suffering this is sadness. It was just this wave of Yuck that just felt like it was going to pummel me down. So I think my practice is just helping me identify it and feel it and see the transitoriness of it. Good. Think we should do some walking now? Could I make a suggestion? That one thing to add to the practice between now and tomorrow evening or nothing special necessarily about tomorrow evening perhaps we'll go into it is in addition to your sitting practice. Now notice these small sufferings and perhaps if you are alert enough to small releases that are possible a common one here maybe you have to be here a little longer is you kind of stake out your particular seat in the dining room and then you come with your tray and suddenly someone else is sitting in your chair and it might be just 10 seconds and again it's small but the yogurt what that taught me is those little things make up a lot of our day sometimes little small buses that don't come on time or leave too quickly or all these slight misses. See if you can pick up on that. There's nothing special. Just live your life here the way you're doing it. Sit and walk and so forth. But see if some sensitivity can be brought into this is what I would call wisdom in action seeing the ways of the mind in action as you do whatever it is you do. And if any of this comes up particularly having to do with eye in mind and maybe we can talk about it tomorrow night I'll say a few more things and then if you do it it'll be more interesting or if you have some experiences between now and tomorrow night then it'll be more alive because you will see some of this in your own life rather than it just being a talk.

Oh there's no such thing. I have a three year old son who is processing this unconscious and every now and then he'll say Mommy today in the park there was an accident and people got killed. What happened to them? And I said they died. And being a Catholic they went to heaven. What would you say to a child? I have to first of all disqualify myself. I don't have children. I was a child. I still am probably. But I've watched and I'm human. It seems to me it would depend on the child how strong or fragile the child is. The total domestic situation of the child. That doesn't sound so terrible. Do you believe it? That the child will get the ideology of going to heaven? And what you just said is that true for you? I believe that there is something out of them.

I have a difficult time talking about God in heaven because I'm more and more interested in the Dharma. But I don't know how to talk about what happened afterwards. But why did you bring that up that the child ask about afterwards? Or is that something you introduced? I would say closer to this fact. Simple. Did the child ask that? Okay.

I'm just now thinking of something. When I grew up I was sheltered from. I loved my grandmother and she died. And I wasn't allowed to go. I wasn't three. I was older than that but not that many years older. And the Jewish way was you stay home the adults go first of all to the hospital. I wanted to be with her. And then I wasn't even allowed to go to the funeral. And I've regretted that. Reincarnation? No it's not really reincarnation. It's rebirth. It's a little different. Okay. But is this for your edification? It doesn't sound like the child. The child is three years old. Why make it introduced a level of complexity. I think it's more immediate. The child. Let's back up. Let's not move away from this just yet because it's on the TV. Okay. See you gave a lot more than the child asked for. That's too late. It's opened the box. But it is necessary I would think. But I really know the limitations of what I'm saying. I would say very close to home. But if we take the Buddha's life that might be of some help. He was given a bunch of Bologna right? He was protected from aging sickness and death. He didn't know the story of the Buddha. And he woke up. Part of awakening was to realize this is natural and part of life. So I'm all for children being gracefully introduced to one meaning of Dharma is natural law. To me that's quite beautiful. It's just the way things are. There is also Buddhist teachings about rebirth but I don't think that's too relevant. There's a distinction between rebirth and reincarnation. In a nutshell reincarnation implies a fixed entity that drops one body and then inhabits the next one and the next one perfecting themselves. In the Buddhist way of thinking rebirth there isn't a fixed entity to begin with. We're just a process. And so this will I think convey it faster than my words. If you have a candle that's burning and then you have another candle that isn't lit and you take the lit one and you light the one that isn't lit. Is that new flame the same or different than the old one? It's not exactly the same but it's also not different. But this is true even while you're alive. In other words there isn't. And it's one of the meanings a very important notion. I left something important out. Okay. Thank you. I'll get through it. Have you heard the teaching of sham of Anata Anata emptiness. Okay. Risk. I do have to take it for all of us adults what the Buddha is saying. And in some sense emptiness is the Crown jewel of the Buddhist teaching. It's a difficult one. Okay let's go to the World Trade Center. The amount of solidity that building had. Now we're hearing what went into building it. And it's like monumental. It's quite an accomplishment. Where is it now? Look Dharma is revealing itself. This natural law is revealing itself in the most peaceful of times. Like impermanence is always true. It is never a second when it's not true and it's everywhere. As the Buddhist said Islam will be like salt is wherever you dip into the ocean. So change constant change. That's the natural law. But when this happened we got a postphd teaching on the fact that life is impermanent. Things change and they change in an uncertain and unpredictable way. If you didn't get that go back and do your homework. It's powerful. Okay. Now was the World Trade Center hallucination? No. It was a beautiful depending on your view creation that it existed but it was empty of inherent existence meaning it didn't have the solidity that we impute to it but nothing does. This used to be my apartment this meditation hall. I lived here for 15 years. Kitchen living room TV set meditation little meditation yoga room. Okay I was kicked out fortunately and I lived down the street because we had to make a larger meditation oil. And towards the end of the process I walked in and my apartment was gone. And I couldn't find anything that was familiar. Even the windows. Nothing. It's empty. But it doesn't mean that those 15 years where it gave me protection a place to heal all kinds of things. It was wonderful. It was a home. I'm grateful it was real during the time that I lived there. But it didn't have an inherent existence that existed from its own side. It came together because of causes and conditions before it was that this was originally a birthing place for the first and only birthing place in Cambridge. Women gave birth and a doctor and his wife lived here. Then a doctor his wife died he married his nurse. Then it became a rooming house. When we got it we got it for not too much money because it was a dilapidated bankrupt failed terrible building. It's all called 331 Broadway. Where's the real 331 Broadway? Right now it's CIMC Cambridge. And we have all the state Buddhas walking Buddhists sitting. And we're building. In a sense it's theater but it's theater to help us create some calm some peace some incentive to look at ourselves to be more loving and so forth. So the teachings are saying okay you can accept that. I know you were nodding with World Trade Center and you understood my apartment. How about you? You're empty too. What we think of as being me this is solid. And this me out of the me thoughts are issued. But this is from the Buddhist point of view. The me is put together by thinking okay you got it. So the rebirth is that process that's not too comforting to people. We want to know that we're going to exist. Why is everyone so incident rebirth? Because they're afraid to die. But the Buddhist teaching is saying that's not really what's important. It's to come to that which is timeless in the Christian religion would be to come to God. Other religions would be called something else. The self in Hinduism perhaps with a big s and so forth. So it's not that this world doesn't exist that my apartment didn't exist but it always existed in that tentative way. And why does the Buddha teach that again and again? To help us. Let go to enjoy what's there while it's there including people we love. But to not get diluted into thinking that this is here forever. You see? Good. Wait. I just want to think. For all of us it was quite a lesson in Dharma. Many things were taught the emptiness of the World Trade Center et cetera. You can't miss it when an event life has happened. So learn from it. Learn from it. That's done to practice too. I'm sorry.

I was upset that I sort of come to the intellectual and maybe virtual limits of pacifist. I spent a lot of time thinking about the death penalty for professional reasons and doing a lot of other things that kind of entrenched it. And suddenly I found something happened that I couldn't at least limit. I couldn't say this is someone still should not be killed. You mean there was someone you felt should be killed inside? I absolutely did. I couldn't find a way to bring myself back. Okay now you haven't choice. There. One is to change. You're not a pacifist anymore. People change all the time. Okay. Another. Is that's the test of your pacifism? You're being challenged. Are you really a pacifist here's someone who's a dirty rotten? I asked. My first Buddhist teacher was a Korean Zen master a wonderful extraordinary wonderful human being. And I said if you were up close to Adolf Hitler at the beginnings of work and you had a chance knowing where this was all going and you had a chance to assassinate him would you do it? And he is. And he paused and paused. He took it seriously. To his credit I think. And then he said in his broken English maybe sometimes kill is okay he said but I would be prepared to pay for it with Karma. I wouldn't get off. If you want to call it the Buddhist way Buddhism maybe. I'm not sure of this. It seems maybe the most Pacific of all the world religions. The emphasis on nonviolence is quite strong. Let's just say it's a very Pacific religion. I don't want to compare with anything else. And that doesn't mean you can't come to the center anymore. Because from my point of view what's important is for you to work out your own life and your own destiny and to come to terms with this. But maybe it's a struggle. Maybe you'll come back to realizing you want to stay with that no matter who that person is and that you were just. You were pushed to the wall and you fell down according to your deepest principles. Or maybe you'll revise it and say Look I was a pacifist but I'm not anymore. And then get comfortable about that because it's true. Yeah.

I like to move slowly. Remember that's still a label and I don't know what it means. And maybe you're in the process of discovering what it means. Great. You're a pacifist. Okay here's where self knowing comes in. Self knowing comes in. What does that do for you? What did it do for you to find out you had urges inside yourself. You didn't know were there killers? Why? In other words everything that we do is pointing back to that which issues the attitude the action. Do you see what I'm getting at? So it's a piece of self knowing. So no matter what it is it can be invaluable. In that it can help you be free and then either be a pastor or not. Keep going. Yes. And the other thing was I was surprised that instead of bringing me down to past sadness or traumas I tried to think of what I could relate to that experience. And I know what grief is so I could relate to that. And that accomplished me for today. And this morning I thought oh yesterday I felt some joy. And then I remembered oh that I felt a grief. I would go to the ups and downs. The first time around I thought when I lost someone I thought this time I was able to recognize it. But you know not only that when the World Trade Center came down the birds are still chirping. The sky is still blue. But there's something a point. I keep seeing some things that I should have said but I didn't. I hope that gatherings like this in order the power of the Sangha is helpful for us. All of us. We all need each other in this way. And then we all go our separate ways to whatever your life is. Whatever my life is. You're all teachers now whether you know it or not the degree to which you can bring this practice into your own life and brings a little bit more stability insanity into your own existence. See if you can help those in your family at work who are not meditators who don't have resources but just not by preaching to them or telling them to come to 331 Broadway but by demonstrating it by being a little bit more grounded. Do you see what I'm saying? For example the woman who's restimulated the feeling of the suicide of her daughter that I mentioned earlier after talking. Look you can be very helpful to people right now. You know what it is to have the law of impermanence and uncertainty. It's not only that things are changing. They're changing in uncertain ways. You know what that is big time already. You can help others with this because you've been with it for five years now. She didn't see herself as having anything valuable to help others with. She saw herself as now a double casualty. So what I'm saying is if you have a practice. She did have a practice. If you have a practice use it. I want to get to this because you're all to me skirting around something that I just can't leave this building unless I make sure we all walk out. And I make sure that I've emphasized this with if I have to hit the Bell I will. I've spoken to some people I've met someone in Bread and Circus today. Oh Larry I'm not King Solomon or just another person like yourself who's going through the same things. So I said look I can tell you one thing. Practice. This person has been practicing for ten years. Yes. No I have been. Of course I've been doing that. I mean I never forgot. I said well then why are you just when we started talking I came back through the back door then through the side door we said oh no of course. What does it mean to look at fear? And it's not just oh fear. And then to experience the energy of fear as it circulates through the body as you feel powerful sensations as the mind keeps producing thoughts that are unempowering. No that's destructive. That are telling you they're all disastrous. You stay with it. You've knocked on your rear end you come back and you work with the energy of fear as best you can sometimes going back to the breath or meta to regain some composure but really sincerely bringing the practice of mindfulness to what is happening in a sustained way. One of the most important things that Vipassana is about is learning how in general not about this event learning how to receive our own experience expanding our capacity to do that. We humans don't have a large capacity to receive our own experience. We have strong likes and dislikes. Freudi. The unconscious is rich. We don't want to know this. We don't want to know that this is all right. If you practice more and more what you're doing is you're finally making friends with yourself which is all those different forces that so to speak live inside of you. And so this is as I say a postphd course. It's just like bringing up whatever it brings up. Be willing to face it to learn from it. And real practice is not just catching a glimpse or making a mental note. Fear and then moving on. That's not even what that method is designed to do. The mental note is designed to help you stay in a non judgmental way with what it is you're experiencing. So is that what you're doing? Are you really practicing? Yes. I've made you more anxious. What's? Okay is there fear? No I do it's rhetorical but I need to. Yeah. I'm not a priest. No but I don't know what Joseph did. Yes there are many things that can be useful. But what I'm trying to emphasize is bring the practice. If ever there's a time to draw upon whatever level of skill you have it's now. And if fear is with you. Yes. Now I'm not saying rub your head in it. Sometimes take a walk in the woods. Notice that the birds are still chirping. Sometimes. Do some lovingkindness meditation take a warm bath. It's not to crush all joy and to be obsessed with fear but if it's there obviously what it means to practice is to meet it in a friendly affectionate way. By the way we're not at war with fear. Our own fear. How to meet it in a soft way. There's a very old image that can be kind of useful. I hope for you right now. What's the attitude that you would observe fear with? And this may sound pretty far fetched. It's like a grandma or a grandpa watching children at play. It's not the event. No one's trying to water down the event or sugarcoat it's that this is all coming out of you. The mindfulness is you the breathing is you. The feeling is you the body is you. It's sort of you being affectionate with you rather than fear is this energy that's invaded from alien sources. Do you see what I'm getting at? It's your fear. And so soften. But to soften in this way. That's what I meant by sensitivity vulnerability. But it takes great strength. But I don't know of anything better to do than this. If you can't do this or don't want to do this there are many people who don't. Most human beings don't. But you happen to walk into the Cambridge Insight Meditation Center. We could pray and chant and that's all useful too. But to me that doesn't go deep enough. That's a bias. Obviously it's self serving because this is what I do. Yeah. Please. I forgive you. I think so. You have to do the best you can. Look because certain white people put hoods over their heads and lynch black people. Does that mean that every time you see anyone how could you can't live that way? Well but you see what an event like this produces is there is more. It's asking you to be more vigilant. Are a certain kind of people? Apparently not. Okay. But what you can do is stay awake. Look you can't help but be awake to this now and use your practice so that you don't inordinately suffer and also make some innocent people suffer. You can be awake without having to be so anxious all the time. Pay attention if you see anything suspicious what more can you do? Look the atmosphere has been polluted. Now if you want the external world to provide you with a peaceful canvas can't do that. So the only hope you have is inner work. It's not saying become a dumb dumb but it is saying most Muslims are not terrorists. Both facts are true. Some are. Okay I don't want to get into the history sociology but it's about you. It's not about cultural. This is not talking heads on CNN. It's about you. No good. You want to what then? That's what you have to practice with. Whatever you tell me I'm going to throw the ball back to you. You're uncomfortable about it then that's what you become aware of. Okay. Refine that process so that there is some careful looking without the tension that goes along with it. That's something that practice helps you with your own tent. Things come up. You can learn how to be economists as you observe things in yourself which are rather unpleasant. You can learn how to do that.

Good. There's something that I talked about with a group of people and I realized that it had a tremendous charge when I spoke about it during the Vietnam War when I was 16. And it has to do with backing America and being a citizen. It was 1970 and the first big marches were happening in Washington. Friends of mine were getting tear gas and I had some guys come up to me and said you think we should bring our boys home do you? And I wasn't going. I knew what I felt and thought but I also knew it was a trap. If they wanted somebody to pound on which they did. But it didn't just like happen then became their target. So they were like these stealth attacks. It wasn't enough to confront me around a bunch of people. So at the same time I was trying to write a paper a history paper on why look into the question whether or not it was okay to bomb Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Just having grown up with those images and those incredible devastation whether or not it was necessary and believing in my heart that it really wasn't okay to waste that many people political ends. And then at the same time being confronted again and again with guys they threatened to kill me. I mean things just escalated because I kept getting away. So they had to I don't know. Could you bring it up today to what's going on right now? See all this is in your computer in memory right? And part of what's being reawakened is that there was this kind of flag waving sentiment that was covering up a will to do violence. And I became their target. And I'm really part of the grief is about what happened. And I've just been having this really sickening feeling about where things could go in this country. True. And that's kind of like hard to hold. I want to be proud to live in a country that enables us to practice the faith of our choice without period of persecution. Who's persecuting you? Who's persecuting you? Now maybe it's the ghost of sidewavers. Okay but that's what I'm suggesting is that. But it's a real gut level. It wasn't a head thing. It wasn't a philosophical thing. These guys. Yes but right now it's memory. It's over and it's influencing how you experience the present. That's true of all of us everyone in this room whether this happened or not we don't see the present. We see it through yesterday's eyes. Part of what the job of Dharma practice of repository meditation is to undercut that and to see with freshness. And the only way that I know that you can get to that is to see all the things you're telling me about. So your practice is to see but to see them for what they are. These are memories that are coloring your present. You're not too sold on it. No it's really true. I'm not saying it's easy. It really caught me by surprise. Oh yes. I didn't expect. This is only the second time I told this story in Dion. And it's like I tell the story and I pay this huge charge and it's almost like the screen goes blank. Once in a while. I make eye contact with you and I'm back in the present. Okay? That's what you have to have to practice with. Let me put this on a bigger Dharma canvas if you don't mind me. When you go deeper in meditation when anyone does you leave behind being an American. There's no American in the silent mind. An American does not get enlightened. That would be idiotic. Nor does a Pakistani nor does a man or a woman. Nor does an old person a young person whatever you want. This is a place that is. Okay I think you understand what I'm saying now. It's a subtle point of the teaching. There's something called attachment to emptiness. Or in Zen they call it distinct of emptiness which is that you get so pure that is I'm beyond being this that and the other. And essentially you've created a very subtle dualism where there's you that's awakened and beyond all patriotism chauvinism. After all once there wasn't in America it's a convention. It was created and it'll fall apart someday. Planet Earth won't last forever either. It's just the law of impression. So all of that happens. And because you've attached to being beyond all that then you've set up another opposition with those people who love their country and put out a flag for whatever reason and so forth. Attachment to emptiness or let's say the medicine for that is to understand. This comes from the Heart Sutra. I hope some of you all of you read it someday. Form is emptiness. Emptiness is form. That is you can't separate these two. So that what makes it sane would be you can come back to being an American who's liberated because it'll never be the same because you have a different relationship to being an American being a this an X or Y or Z. There's no question about that. It's in its place. It's not the deepest thing about a human being. None of these countries are nor ethnic groups nor races. Look I have come from a very Jewish background 14 generations of rabbis. Is that enough? Okay. That's not the deepest thing about me. It really isn't and I know it but that is an effect an influence in my consciousness that I'm not at war with. It it's there. There's some good things in it. There's some things that I have to watch out because they poison my mind in certain ways that I don't want and so forth. Okay so now we have a fresh new situation. What does it mean? I told you how I wave my flag. But look most people in Cambridge are with you. They're ready to lynch me. Look people in this center they nearly fainted when I said Larry I mean I refused to bear arms for two years. I went to hell to get that status in the military in the infantry for two years. So I didn't have to bit. But I served and I was in the anti war movement and everything you're talking about I know it well from the inside and I'm not waving a flag for me. It's just like the flag at Half Mass. It's just grieving. I know that America also. Let me sketch this out. It's a very big thing. We're dealing with all of us. I've experienced sorrow. Haven't you? Of course we have. But I've seen different kinds of sorrow in myself. Let me give you just two. One was Sunday. I was taking a walk in the park in Boston Commons and I had heard before that in the Sunday morning news and all about we're talking about years. This is a war. And I saw two guys with purple hair and earrings through every orifice that they had. And I looked at them and I got very very sad because what I saw was if this is a war that goes for years they're going to be drafted by buy purple hair buy. And I also know just the thought of having to go through 16 weeks of basic training again which I don't know about that and two years of being even if you believe and you love your country you're not cut out. You don't want to be a soldier but you have to be. It was exhausting. And I felt a certain sorrow for the generation of young men and some women too who are going to have to go over and serve and be part of a military and go through what I know they have to go through. I did not love two years that I put in. I did it. I also have felt sorrow not unrelated to this that is not particularly American. It had to do with the collective timeless sorrow of we human beings. That is the level of ignorance. It's a human problem. The whole planet is this where we've arrived at with our extraordinary computers and getting to the moon. And of course then you get to what some people would think of as utopian. Some kind of inner transformation is what has been neglected. We know a tremendous amount about stuff which finally isn't all that important. We know very little about what is most precious. We don't know how to live together. We don't know how to live together because we can't live with ourselves. We're in conflict. How can we expect our leaders not to be in conflict? So that's a big one. Conferences. They may help. I'm all for it. I'm for the United Nations peace summits meetings and all that. But unless the human race decides to allocate its energies in a somewhat different way through the school system radically changing education so that what is held to be important is wisdom compassion self knowledge. Not special just for people who become monks and nuns who have fallow complexion. It's just a general cultural value. And it's why? Because we can't survive. Otherwise we have to learn how to live with each other. And then there are some religious texts that imply hey that's hopeless. This is the curriculum on planet Earth. They're going to be all these ignorant people and there are going to be a few who see it and don't want to be and they get liberated. And then there's the rebirth process Karma. And so it goes on. The curriculum is not going to change because that comes from someplace much deeper than your nice educational program to radically reeducate the human race. Keep it simple. Stick to the present moment. That's the best thing I know for these times. Don't get too far ahead of yourself. Pay attention. That's really the essence of good practice. Keep it simple and stick to the present moment. It's very hard to do. We spend a huge amount of time in the future and in the past and then as tourists we drop into the present moment. From time to time. We visit it. Maybe when you come to this building what the practice is about is more and more living in the present moment and visiting the future in the past when it makes sense to do so. But I have a lot of what you're talking about too but you got to see through it so you can behave now in a way that's real. That's just my own feeling. Last question. I think please I'm not sure if that's true but maybe let's say it is. I think it's absolutely true. I think it's a wake up call on many levels many levels including spiritual. But one last thing. Are there any people here I don't feel I did to you with your son? Is there anyone any people here who are parents or who are people who work with children a lot who would have something to say that's a little bit more intelligent than what I have to say is more helpful?

I don't think maybe I introduced him initially. You know there are stories in the Buddhist tradition of young children who are five six at the funeral of a parent and as like Dogan a very great Japanese unmaster as the incense stick at the funeral and everyone was sobbing obviously it seemed that there was more realistic treatment of the subject. I'm all for sensibly staying as close to the truth. And I was told that when I asked where do babies come from? You eat a lot of Kasha. That's a grain. But at any rate this was in a Dharmic culture which maybe America is on the way to coming. Maybe that's part of what you're more and more this is getting stronger spirituality let's call it in that culture. Dogana as a very young child became really concerned about the nature of human life and what happens to it at death because he lost a parent. And it wasn't that. It was just morbid. It became the energy that fueled a lifelong self inquiry that resulted in enlightenment. So I think it can be dealt with in a true and honest way. Skillfully depending on the child the situation the timing and most of all you I think please. I'm very relaxed when I answer these questions.

And I'm curious about what they said they needed. They're overwhelmed with support. They had a March to Boston and there were just a tremendous number of people joined them. They have a blood drive. They printed something in the newspaper. They sent out circulars to everyone put it in the mailbox explaining who they were that they're not terrorists. It was intelligent beautifully worded. You could feel the worry there. But I've seen here's small signs. I buy The New York Times almost every morning at this store 24 and there's a young woman who's behind the counter and she has I don't know the name Kerchief. And a long two days ago I came in no Kerchief blue jeans. And I realized safety parents are saying yeah. So look we want to avoid what happened with the Japanese but there's going to be no way to totally avoid some mistreatment of people this way. There are too many people who are ignorant. There are too many people who are desperate who are grieving themselves and don't know how to handle it. What we can do is minimize it in our own each one of us in our world there are small things you can do. I got into a cab last week and it was clear that the guy driving was Islamic. I'm not some big psychic. Yes. So I debated whether to open it up or not. I said where are you from? And he got very you could see tense and he said after he didn't answer he got Syria. And then I just made small talk with him about it. I didn't try to give him a sermon about we Americans. We know you're a grand blah blah blah. I just established just a normal conversation with them. There are ways in which you can reassure people can we just have a few seconds of silence? May we all looked deeply into ourselves? May we see things exactly as they are? May this clear saying bring with it peace inner peace which we can share.", 'human_start_time': '0:51:18'}, {'talkname': '19960701-Larry_Rosenberg-UNK-vipassana_retreat_part_1_of_8-43305', 'question_num': 'Question 1', 'url': '/talks/43305/19960701-Larry_Rosenberg-UNK-vipassana_retreat_part_1_of_8-43305.mp3', 'display_name': 'Vipassana Retreat, Part 1 of 8', 'date': '7/1/96 19:00', 'start_time': 4905990, 'content': "I found that when I was doing the walking meditation my body and my mind were calm and I wondered whether that was because I had one short session of what you're doing. Yes. What you find if you continue to do this practice that each practice reinforces the other so that sitting for a while having calmed down a little bit certainly will help enhance the walking. The walking will then enhance the sitting. And after a while you realize that there's just life going on. That's all there is. But each of these forms we're using them or separating them. But you may also find their individual differences. Some people for example if we were to work together for a while we may find that walking is a very fruitful door for you as a practice. So maybe it would be suggested do more walking meditation a little bit less sitting and that changes as you go on. I had a friend who went to India to study meditation many years ago had read all these books and was really fired up. And then when he got there and found a very wonderful teacher he found that he hated sitting. It was nice reading Alan Watts about it but then it's another thing to do it. And he really had a very very difficult time doing the sitting. But he did enjoy the walking meditation. So his teacher was skillful said don't fight so much do a lot of walking forget about sitting for a while. He's a Zen Monk now so eventually be careful. You don't know what this leads to. You see what I'm getting at? Yeah. Please. It's okay. We have time for everyone. I understand that's. Chronic introspection. Yeah. Which we all know how to do. Nothing personal. I don't know. You right. Sign. I don't mean to be insulting. Okay. And some of that of course is useful. And no one's saying never do that. But it isn't this. So for this part of the practice that would be another distraction. Why does this come? Where did it come from? I knew I should know. Why didn't he? Okay. That's the busyness of the mind. And I'm not saying finding that out is worthless but for right now that's preventing you from see it depends what you've set for yourself to do. If you hand yourself over to this method then what you've set yourself to do is what is being suggested which is to take the simple breath out of all the things you could attend to in life. We've reduced all that complexity to an in breath and an out breath. It's quite dramatic when you think of it. Okay so in out and all this other complexity doesn't go away. It's kind of making demands on you like a child. So that was yours. And for someone else it's sound. For a third person it's endless. So the content is all different. But from our point of view all of it is a distraction. Because what we're learning. Let me give you a sense of why. Because sometimes people do this and they're not motivated. We're letting go of all those other possibilities right. You could be doing what you're doing and every one of us could be following all these creative possibilities in the mind. Instead we let it go and we come back to in out in out and out. What's the point of that? What can come out of that is an unwavering quality of attention which is hard to develop in other ways. An unwavering quality of attention which you can then direct towards whatever else is happening in your life. It's a tremendous asset. Now that unwavering quality of attention is not going to drop from a cloud. And if you want to pray for it I hope you get it. But the only way that I know to get it is you practice it and it's something that can be learned. Many people before us have learned it. And if you read the ancient texts they all sound like what you're saying and what you were saying. The human mind in one sense has not changed at all. So that the training is set up with a realistic understanding how wild a mind is and how many preoccupations it has already. And it's can we replace all that? Not forever. It's just for while we're practicing can you temporarily let it go into obeyance and just enjoy a breathing? Yes. Well see that sounds okay to me. If you can go with it. See what you'll discover is as many of us have that even when we think we're not controlling the breath as you get calmer you realize there was a subtle kind of control going on. So there is a state in the practice which is very clear and observable where you're sitting and it feels as if you're being breathed. Okay. That means there's no effort whatsoever. There's no ego. See here's part of the problem let's say especially for those who are brand new. The breath was not such a big deal right? I mean you know you want to have it because otherwise you're dead. And if you get a cold you care. If you get the wind knocked out of you you care and so forth. But by and large it's not so interesting. Suddenly you found out that there's some cash value in the breathing. The ego has found out that you can get enlightened with this stuff. Wow. So now it wants to get into the act like it wants to get into everything. That we do and it's brilliant. So you want me to be a Yogi? A Vipassana Yogi. Follow the breath. I'll get into that one. The only problem is that that's the problem. I see. You understand. Yeah. So what can we do? If you try to fight with it it's more of the same. If you try not to control isn't that a kind of control? So it's hopeless. Just give up and observe. You trying to make things be a certain way. And as you do that sometimes it's just so humorous that you stop. But little by little you learn the art of not calculating so much not controlling so much to allow nature to unfold. This will be very important because if you can learn it on the breath just to get a little bit ahead of ourselves. Supposing you're tired of being afraid or whatever other problem cults you've brought here as a human being. It turns out that the way to go beyond fear is to learn how to allow fear to surface and for you to be intimate with fear to really examine it. Otherwise everything else short of that seems to be an escape from fear and we can't get free. So the lessons we're learning on the breath simple minded as it may seem are actually big ones. Because as we learn how to allow this breath to happen quite naturally and give the calculating mind a break give it a rest. It doesn't mean forever. When you go back to work on Monday you need a calculating mind. But here you don't. Does that make any sense? I knew there was a butt in there. Right. Okay. It's the same mind that wants to have perfect breathing. Also has a butt. All right. What's hard to live with all this is thinking isn't it? Finally you'll see the first teacher I had was a Korean Zen master. And I would come into every interview interview after interview for weeks. This is a longer treat. And he would just say too much thinking. That was the only help he gave me. We kind of pamper you a little bit. We give you all these words too much thinking. But it turns out that finally that was the problem. Okay. So then one day I came in I had a sitting where the mind was very quiet and joyful and I was just flowing with the breathing. And I came in and I said I'm so happy. And I said no thinking. I didn't have any thinking for about 15 minutes. And he looked at me and said what's wrong with thinking? See because then you get attached to that. The point is we're learning how to. Yeah but for right now that would be a good attachment. If you can have no thinking let's get that's. All right. And then we'll learn how to let go of that one. But you'll see that all of them are versions of the mind. One way or another. Look the activity is so simple minded just here's in out in out. Just notice it right? It's not rocket science. That's why it's difficult. Perhaps it's very simple. Yeah please. And the last six years. I do but I don't want to get ahead of ourselves. But that's where the insight work really comes in to be very helpful. It's how you do the watching and what it is that you see. But we will definitely get that if I don't bring you that case up specifically. Remind me. Yes you understood. Saying that what? Okay I understand. It's not really a matter of balance so much as right now those are two different practices. Both are related. They work together like the right and the left hand. Right now all we're learning how to do is to calm and concentrate the mind. Here's the logic of it. It's not complicated either. As we learn to calm and concentrate the mind isn't a calm and concentrated mind in a much better position to observe fear. If the mind itself is all over the place what's going.", 'human_start_time': '1:21:45'}]}
